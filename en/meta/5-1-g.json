The proportion of funds allocated to projects in German DC that promote gender equality serves as an indicator of the fulfilment of national and international commitments to gender equality.<br><br>Since 1997, the <abbr title=\"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\" tabindex=\"0\">OECD</abbr>-DAC gender equality marker (GG marker) has been mandatory to ensure that gender aspects are taken into account in international development cooperation. The GG marker distinguishes between projects marked as GG1&nbsp;and GG2. GG2&nbsp;projects pursue gender equality as their primary objective, with the promotion of gender equality and the fight against gender-based discrimination being core aims of the initiative. Projects marked GG1&nbsp;consider gender aspects as an important but secondary objective. To ensure that gender equity remains relevant in GG1&nbsp;projects, the <abbr title=\"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\" tabindex=\"0\">OECD</abbr> requires a gender analysis and the presence of at least one relevant output indicator when assigning the GG1&nbsp;marker.<br><br>Both GG1&nbsp;and GG2&nbsp;projects are included in the indicator. While GG2&nbsp;projects have a stronger focus on gender equality, GG1&nbsp;projects often have a broader reach.
