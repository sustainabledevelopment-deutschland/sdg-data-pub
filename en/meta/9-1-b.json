In addition to enhancing international competitiveness, the expansion of broadband availability with gigabit speeds is intended to facilitate the convergence of living standards across Germany. To achieve these aims, the predominantly private sector roll-out is to be supported by public funding schemes in unprofitable areas.","data_state":"The data published in the indicator report 2022 is as of 31 October 2022. The data shown on this platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/publications_reports/\">indicator report 2022</a>.","indicator_name":"Rollout of broadband","section":"Innovation","postulate":"Shaping the future sustainably with new solutions","target_id":"9.1.1","previous":"9-1-a","next":"10-1","content_and_progress":"<b>Text from the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/publications_reports/\">Indicator Report 2022&nbsp;</a></b><br><br>The indicator measures the availability of broadband to households in Germany at downstream speeds of at least 1,000&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Megabit per second\" tabindex=\"0\">Mbps</abbr>, or one gigabit per second, using wired technology&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;fibre optics (<abbr title=\"Fibre-to-the-Building/Fibre-to-the-Home\" tabindex=\"0\">FTTB/H</abbr>) and cable television (<abbr title=\"Cable television\" tabindex=\"0\">CATV</abbr>). The figures are collated on behalf of the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure and published on the Government\u2019s Broadband Atlas.<br><br>As of the middle of 2021, fully fibre-optic internet connections (<abbr title=\"Fibre-to-the-Building/Fibre-to-the-Home\" tabindex=\"0\">FTTB/H</abbr>) capable of more than 1,000&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Megabit per second\" tabindex=\"0\">Mbps</abbr> were available in 15.4&nbsp;% of households in Germany. Between 2015&nbsp;and 2021, the availability of 1,000&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Megabit per second\" tabindex=\"0\">Mbps</abbr> FTTB/H broadband rose by 8.7&nbsp;percentage points. In other words, it more than doubled, increasing by +&nbsp;130&nbsp;%. From the end of 2018&nbsp;to the middle of 2021, the proportion of households with equally rapid connections using <abbr title=\"Cable television\" tabindex=\"0\">CATV</abbr> grew from 23.7&nbsp;% to 56.5&nbsp;%. This is also more than double, equating to a +&nbsp;138&nbsp;% increase. Altogether, 62.1&nbsp;% of households had gigabit-capable connections available as of mid-2021.<br><br>For all technologies, the provision of gigabit broadband is concentrated particularly in urban areas, where some 78.4&nbsp;% of households had gigabit-speed internet access as of 2021. That figure is markedly lower for areas of a rural character, at 22.9&nbsp;% in 2021. To consider the distribution of the different technologies, 75.1&nbsp;% of urban and 12.8&nbsp;% of rural households had gigabit connections via <abbr title=\"Cable television\" tabindex=\"0\">CATV</abbr> in mid-2021, while gigabit-capable fibre broadband was available to 18.6&nbsp;% of households in urban areas and 11.3&nbsp;% of those in rural areas.<br><br>Differences in availability between urban and more rural areas are also discernible among the L\u00e4nder. Of all the L\u00e4nder that are not city states, Schleswig-Holstein has the highest level of gigabit-speed provision using any technology in 2021, at 79.7&nbsp;% of all households, followed by Lower Saxony on 66.8&nbsp;%. At the other end of the scale, 26&nbsp;% of households in Saxony-Anhalt can say the same, with Brandenburg the next-lowest at 29.4&nbsp;%. In contrast, provision of gigabit-speed broadband is markedly higher than 90&nbsp;% in the three city states, Berlin, Bremen and Hamburg.<br><br>The foundation for the distinction between urban and rural areas is solely the population density for this indicator. The information about gigabit broadband are collected from more than 150&nbsp;telecommunications companies in Germany. They are asked about their current provision. To preserve the companies\u2019 business and trade secrets, the resultant data are aggregated into a grid of 250-metre by 250-metre cells (from 2022: 100x100&nbsp;metre) and grouped according to seven classes of broadband. Although full-fibre networks with speeds of over 1,000&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Megabit per second\" tabindex=\"0\">Mbps</abbr> have been included in observations since the end of 2015, that class has only been studied in detail since the end of 2018&nbsp;in light of the latest technological advances.<br><br>Methodologically, it should be noted that the telecom companies provide their data on broadband availability on a voluntary basis until the revision of the Telecommunications Act on 1&nbsp;December 2021. Furthermore, the figures for availability refer to the technology that telecom companies have installed, as opposed to the actually usable broadband capacity in the area. Additional information on broadband measurement can be found in the annual report of the Bundesnetzagentur, Germany\u2019s federal networks agency.","embedded_feature_html":"<p>Additional data series for the indicator can be found <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/AddInfos/en/9_1_b.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" >here</a>.</p><br><small>Note: You can display the PDF document directly in your browser or download the PDF document and open it with a PDF reader of your choice.
