It covers wired technologies such as fibre to the building or home (FTTB/H) and hybrid fibre coaxial (HFC, formerly cable television). The data basis for the analysis is regularly updated coverage data from over 150&nbsp;telecommunications providers.<br><br>As of the end of 2024, fibre connections offering speeds of at least 1,000&nbsp;Mbit/s are available to 39.8% of households in Germany. Between 2015&nbsp;and 2024, the availability of FTTB/H connections with at least 1,000&nbsp;Mbit/s increased by 33.1&nbsp;percentage points, representing an almost sixfold rise (+494%). From the end of 2018&nbsp;to the end of 2024, the proportion of households with access to 1,000&nbsp;Mbit/s via HFC rose from 23.7% to 62.4%, more than doubling (+163%). Altogether, by the end of 2024, gigabit-capable wired connections are available to 77.9% of all private households.<br><br>Gigabit broadband availability across all wired technologies is particularly concentrated in densely populated areas. In such areas, 90.4% of households have access to at least one gigabit connection. In medium-density areas, the proportion is significantly lower at 76.9%, and in sparsely populated areas, availability is only 51.5%. When considering only gigabit fibre connections, the regional disparity is less pronounced: By the end of 2024, 42.5% of households in densely populated areas have access to a gigabit-capable fibre connection. In both medium- and low-density areas, the proportion is around 38%.<br><br>There are also differences in availability across the L\u00e4nder. Among the larger territorial states, Schleswig-Holstein reports the highest proportion of households with access to gigabit connections via all technologies, at 91.6% in 2024, followed by Niedersachsen with 86.3%. The lowest availability is in Th\u00fcringen (55.7%), followed by Sachsen-Anhalt (62.8%). In comparison, the three city-states&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;Berlin, Bremen, and Hamburg&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;each have a gigabit availability rate of over 95%, significantly exceeding the national average for densely populated areas.<br><br>Despite the progress made, the political target of nationwide fixed-line gigabit coverage by 2025&nbsp;is unlikely to be fully achieved.</p>","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://bmdv.bund.de/EN/Home/home.html\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the Federal Ministry of Transport', 'En')\">Federal Ministry of Transport</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://bmdv.bund.de/EN/Home/home.html\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the Federal Ministry of Transport', 'En')\">Federal Ministry of Transport</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://bmdv.bund.de/EN/Home/home.html\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the Federal Ministry of Transport', 'En')\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/bmv.png\" alt=\"Federal Ministry of Transport\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Ministry of Transport\" style=\"height:60px;
