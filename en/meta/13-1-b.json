These include measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, measures for climate change adaptation, as well as climate-related actions aimed at preserving biodiversity and protecting forests. The funds are drawn from the federal budget and are predominantly deployed in developing and emerging economies. Since 2017, so-called grant equivalents of development loans have also been included in the calculation. These imputed values represent the financial benefit of concessional loans compared with standard market conditions.<br><br>The data are provided by the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), which also incorporates information on climate finance from other federal ministries. For bilateral climate finance, committed funds are taken into account, whereas for multilateral climate finance and contributions to energy and climate funds, actual disbursements are used as the basis. In addition, the indicator covers the proportion of climate finance within Germany\u2019s contributions to multilateral funds administered by development banks.<br><br>The politically established target stipulates that, from 2025&nbsp;onwards, at least 6&nbsp;billion euros per year will be allocated to international climate finance, both to reduce emissions and to support adaptation measures. This target was already met in 2022&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;three years ahead of schedule&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;with 6.39&nbsp;billion euros. In 2023, the committed or disbursed federal budget funds amounted to 5.66&nbsp;billion euros. This represents a decline of 11% and once again falls short of the target. The previous target, applicable until 2020, to increase climate finance to 4&nbsp;billion euros annually, was already surpassed in 2019&nbsp;with 4.34&nbsp;billion euros and has been consistently exceeded since.<br><br>In 2023, 57% of international climate finance was allocated to greenhouse gas mitigation measures and 43% to adaptation measures. Overall, projects were implemented in more than 80&nbsp;countries. Approximately 79% of climate finance (in terms of financial volume) in 2023&nbsp;was provided through bilateral cooperation with partner countries, while the remaining 21% was channelled via multilateral mechanisms.<br><br>In addition to public climate finance from the federal budget, the KfW Development Bank and the Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft (DEG) provide climate-related loans and financing from market-based resources. These so-called <i>mobilised public climate finance</i> flows are not included in the indicator. In 2023, these resources amounted to approximately 3.81&nbsp;billion euros, compared with 3.09&nbsp;billion euros in the previous year.</p>","download_content":"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/indicator_downloads_en/13-1-b.pdf","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bmz.de/en\" target=\"_blank\"
