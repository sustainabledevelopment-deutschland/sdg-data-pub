The source of the annually collected data is the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, which also reports in this context on climate finance from other federal ministries. In the case of bilateral climate finance, expenditure is calculated on the basis of funds allocated; in the case of multilateral climate finance and contributions to energy and climate funds, it is calculated on the basis of funds actually paid. The indicator also includes climate finance that is attributed to donors pro rata on the basis of their contributions to multilateral funds managed by development banks. As climate finance primarily benefits developing countries, it is considered to be part of official development expenditure (see indicator 17.1&nbsp;\u201cOfficial development assistance as a proportion of gross national income\u201d).<br><br>In 2021, Germany committed or provided 5.34&nbsp;billion euros in public funds for international climate finance for the reduction of greenhouse gases and adaptation to climate change. Compared with the previous year, when climate finance amounted to 5.09&nbsp;billion euros, this represents an increase of 4.9&nbsp;%. The target for 2025&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;to reach 6&nbsp;billion euros&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;will most likely be achieved if the development continues. The previous target&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;to reach 4&nbsp;billion euros by 2020&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;was already achieved in 2019&nbsp;at 4.34&nbsp;billion euros. In 2021, 36&nbsp;% of climate finance went to fund projects to reduce emissions, while 33&nbsp;% went towards adaptation to climate change. The remaining 30&nbsp;% was used to finance horizontal measures. As the horizontal measures serve both the reduction and adaptation efforts, the final split in 2021, as in previous years, shows more funds being used for emissions reduction (51&nbsp;%) than for adaptation (49&nbsp;%).<br><br>18&nbsp;% of climate finance, or 971&nbsp;million euros, was provided through multilateral channels in 2021. 268&nbsp;million euros of that can be attributed to Germany on the basis of the climate-related shares of Germany\u2019s contributions to multilateral development banks, the Global Environment Facility and the International Fund for Agricultural Development. Germany provides the remaining 703&nbsp;million euros through multilateral institutions and contributions to international climate funds.<br><br>In addition to official climate finance from public funds, Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (<abbr title=\"Reconstruction Loan Corporation\" tabindex=\"0\">KfW</abbr>) and <abbr title=\"German Investment and Development Corporation\" tabindex=\"0\">DEG</abbr> (Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft) also provide climate-related loans with funds from the market. These represent mobilised public climate finance and are not included in the indicator. In 2021, the resources mobilised in this way amounted to approximately 2.59&nbsp;billion euros, compared with 2.55&nbsp;billion euros the previous year. Here too, more funding went towards emissions reduction (58&nbsp;%) than adaptation (42&nbsp;%).","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bmz.de/en\">Federal Ministry for
