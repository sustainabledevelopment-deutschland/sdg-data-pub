The Textiles Partnership comprises ordinary, advisory and associate members. The ordinary membership is subdivided into what are known as stakeholder groups: the businesses (initiatives and associations), unions, non-governmental organisations, standards organisations and the German Federal Government. A standards organisation is a body that offers or develops non-commercial standards for sustainable textiles. Membership of the Textiles Partnership is voluntary and is obtained by application.","dns_indicator_intention":"The Partnership for Sustainable Textiles is a multi-stakeholder initiative that was founded in 2014. The Textiles Partnership aims to improve the underlying social, ecological and economic conditions in the producer countries. Membership numbers should therefore be increased significantly by 2030.","data_state":"The data published in the indicator report 2022 is as of Oct 31 2022.

Being a multi-stakeholder initiative, the Textiles Partnership has more than just business enterprises in its ranks. On the basis of jointly defined Partnership objectives, each company, by joining the Textiles Partnership, pledges to implement measures for continuous improvement of conditions and for compliance with social and environmental objectives of the Partnership throughout the company\u2019s supply chain. To this end, since 2017&nbsp;all members are bound to draw up individual action plans known as road maps. These road maps are then reviewed for plausibility by an external service provider.<br><br>In its founding year of 2014, 59&nbsp;members joined the Textiles Partnership. The end of 2016&nbsp;saw membership reach its peak, having more than trebled to 188. Since the introduction of the compulsory plans of action, however, there have been expulsions and several withdrawals from the Textiles Partnership. On the one hand, some members were expelled for non-fulfilment of their reporting obligations. On the other hand, some members withdrew, citing compliance costs or insufficient relevance, which meant that total membership stood at 124&nbsp;at the end of December 2019. Of the original founding members that joined in October or November 2014, there were still 30&nbsp;in the Partnership at the end of December 2019. Over that five-year period there was an overall downward trend in the number of members.<br><br>At the end of December 2019, 75&nbsp;out of 124&nbsp;members (60%) were classed as companies; eight of them did not have their registered office in Germany. If a company is a member of the Textiles Partnership, this does not necessarily mean that its main economic activity is in the field of textiles and/or clothing manufacture. According to the statistical business register of the Federal Statistical Office, some 70% of the member companies operated primarily in the manufacture, wholesaling or retailing of textiles and/or clothing in 2019. Their aggregate turnover in 2019&nbsp;amounted to <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 17.4&nbsp;billion. According to the trade statistics of the Federal Statistical Office, total retail turnover for the whole of 2018&nbsp;amounted to <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 579.6&nbsp;billion, while total wholesale turnover came to <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 1,325.6&nbsp;billion. About 4.8% of these amounts were earned by companies primarily assigned to the wholesale and retail sector through sales of clothing, textiles and curtains, excluding footwear, leather goods and carpets.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bmz.de/en\">Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.bmz.de/en\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bmz.de/en\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"www.dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/bmz.png\" alt=\"Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","source_url_1":"https://www.textilbuendnis.com/en/uebersicht/","source_url_text_1":"Members of the Partnership for Sustainable Textiles","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"<a href=\"https://www.giz.de/en/html/index.html\">Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH</a>","source_organisation_2_short":"<a href=\"https://www.giz.de/en/html/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH</a>","source_organisation_logo_2":"<a href=\"https://www.giz.de/en/html/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"www.dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/giz.png\" alt=\"Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationDeutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","weather_active_1":true,"weather_indicator_1":"8.6 Members of the Textile Partnership","weather_indicator_1_year_a":2021,"weather_indicator_1_year_b":2020,"weather_indicator_1_year_c":2019,"weather_indicator_1_target":"Significantly increase by 2030","weather_indicator_1_target_1":"Significantly increase by 2030","weather_indicator_1_target_1_category":"normal","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a":"Blitz","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_title":"In 2021 neither the average value nor the last change pointed in the right direction.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b_title":"In 2020 the average value aimed in the wrong direction or indicates stagnation, but the previous year had shown a turn in the desired direction.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c":"Leicht bew\u00f6lkt","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c_title":"In 2019 the average development aimed in the right direction, but in the previous year there had been a development in the wrong direction or no change at all.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c_valid":true,"data_show_map":false,"copyright":"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2022","data_footnote":"As of Dec. 31&nbsp;of the respective year.","graph_title":"Members of the Textile Partnership","span_gaps":true,"show_line":true,"graph_type":"bar","data_start_values":[{"field":"Time series","value":"Members of the Textile Partnership"}],"national_geographical_coverage":"Germany","page_content":"\n\n<div>\n  <div class=\"my-header\">\n    <label class=\"default\">Members of the Textile Partnership: increase number by 2030\n      <a href=\"www.dns-indikatoren.de/en/status\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/Wettersymbole/Blitz.png\" title=\"In 2021 neither the average value nor the last change pointed in the right direction.\" alt=\"Weathersymbol: Thuder strom\"/>\n      </a>\n    </label>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"my-header-note\">\n  <label class=\"default\"><b>(Evaluation of the indicator report 2022 relating to the reporting year 2021)\n  </b></label>\n</div>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-28","national_data_updated_date":"2022-11-28","indicator_number":"8.6","target_number":"8.6","goal_number":"8","language":"en"}
