Final use covers domestic consumption and domestic investments as well as exports.<br>The denominator of the indicator takes into account abiotic and biotic raw materials from the environment as well as plant materials produced by farming and forestry. In the graph, the development of the indicator itself and of both the numerator and the denominator are traced separately.","dns_indicator_intention":"The extraction of raw materials always entails some impairment of the natural environment. Owing to the growing demand for raw materials, raw material deposits in all parts of the world are increasingly being extracted in areas that are particularly sensitive to human intervention. For this reason, back in 2016, in the German Resource Efficiency Programme (ProgRess) II, the Federal Government set itself the goal of ensuring a continuing rise in raw material input productivity. In the years 2000&nbsp;to 2010, raw material input productivity was already increasing at an average rate of around 1.6&nbsp;% annually. The aim is to maintain this kind of positive trend up to 2030.","data_state":"The data published in the indicator report 2022 is as of 31 October 2022. The data shown on this platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/publications_reports/\">indicator report 2022</a>.","indicator_name":"Raw material input productivity","section":"Resource conservation","postulate":"Using resources economically and efficiently","target_id":"8.1.1","previous":"7-2-b","next":"8-2-ab","content_and_progress":"<b>Text from the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/publications_reports/\">Indicator Report 2022&nbsp;</a></b><br><br>To calculate this indicator, it is necessary to determine the mass of all raw materials required to produce the imports. The calculation of this variable, referred to as imports in raw material equivalents, is based on a complex model that employs data from various official and unofficial sources.<br><br>Due to the monetary and physical inclusion of imports, the indicator takes into account the value added and raw material use across the entire production chain both inside and outside of Germany. In this way, the economic interdependence with foreign countries is also taken into account comprehensively. The raw material use mapped in the indicator covers not only domestic final use but also exports. It should therefore not be confused with a resource footprint for Germany.<br><br>The indicator includes not only the raw materials that were considered to be non-renewable, that is, mineral raw materials and fossile fuels, but also plant-based products from farming and forestry activities. This means that double counting occurs to a limited degree. For example, both the mass of an agricultural product at harvest time as well as that of the mineral fertiliser used to produce it are recorded.<br><br>The value of the indicator increased by 26&nbsp;% from 2000&nbsp;to 2018. This increase results in particular from the growth of the numerator: the value of the final use (domestic consumption and domestic investments as well as exports) increased by 46&nbsp;% during the reference period. The removal of domestic raw materials fell moderately between 2000&nbsp;and 2018; at the same time, however, the mass of imports in raw material equivalents increased, causing a slight increase of 16&nbsp;% in the indicator\u2019s denominator.<br><br>Domestically extracted raw materials as well as imports are also being exported (again) to an increasing degree. Consequently, the indicator\u2019s denominator does not point to increased global raw material extraction for consumption and investment in Germany, but reflects generally more intensive links between the German economy and the outside world.<br><br>The year 2009&nbsp;should be considered an outlier due to the exceptional economic situation in the European financial market and economic crisis. In 2010&nbsp;and 2011, investments and exports, as well as the associated input of raw materials, rose sharply again. This marked a resumption of the trend that had been seen in the period up to 2008. Although raw material input productivity slightly decreased or stagnated at some points in time, the general trend tended to improve. The indicator increased by 5&nbsp;percentage points in 2017&nbsp;compared to the preceding year, however, 2018&nbsp;recorded a slight decline by 1&nbsp;percentage point. In total, raw material input productivity increased from 2010&nbsp;to 2018&nbsp;by 9&nbsp;percentage points with an average annual growth of 0.9&nbsp;% and, thus, lies below the target of the Federal Government.","embedded_feature_html":"<p>Additional data series for the indicator can be found <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/AddInfos/en/8_1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" >here</a>.</p><br><small>Note: You can display the PDF document directly in your browser or download the PDF document and open it with a PDF reader of your choice.
