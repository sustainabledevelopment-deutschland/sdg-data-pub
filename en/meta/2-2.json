The basis for this classification lies in the international norms and recommendations for the realisation of the right to food, as defined in the Global Strategic Framework (GSF) of the Committee on World Food Security (CFS). Data collection is carried out by the Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Rural Areas (BMLEH) and the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). The methodology differs between the years before and after 2019.<br><br>In 2016&nbsp;and 2018, Official Development Assistance (ODA) projects in the field of food security were classified as contributions to the promotion of good governance if:<br>a) a guideline or recommendation of the CFS GSF on food security was explicitly mentioned in the objectives, results framework, or project description; or<br>b) a central substantive element of such a guideline or recommendation constituted a significant component of the project, and the project simultaneously aimed to strengthen legal, institutional, or policy frameworks.<br><br>From 2020&nbsp;onwards, data collection has been based on OECD-DAC data. Projects are deemed to contribute to the promotion of good governance in the field of food security if they:<br>a) contain a Common Reporting Standard (CRS) code and relevant keywords relating to food security; and<br>b) include a governance-related marker and keywords covering the core elements of a guideline or recommendation of the CFS GSF.<br><br>Due to the change in methodology, results before and after 2019&nbsp;are only partially comparable.<br><br>As the indicator is expressed as a proportion of total expenditure related to food security, it does not provide information on trends in absolute expenditure on food security, nor on the total volume of support for good governance in this field. Germany\u2019s total ODA disbursements increased markedly from 22,368&nbsp;million euros in 2016&nbsp;to 29,165&nbsp;million euros in 2022. Public expenditure on food security also rose steadily over the same period&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;both in absolute terms, from 887&nbsp;million euros in 2016&nbsp;to 2,461&nbsp;million euros in 2022, and in relative terms, from 4.0% to 8.4% of total ODA disbursements.<br><br>Public development expenditure aimed at supporting good governance in the area of food security increased by around 40% from 148&nbsp;million euros in 2016&nbsp;to 207&nbsp;million euros in 2022. However, this growth was lower than the overall increase in food security expenditure, resulting in a decline in the indicator value: while in 2016, 16.7% of food security expenditure was attributed to good governance support, this share had fallen to 8.4% by 2022. Relative to total public development expenditure, spending on both governance and food security remains comparatively small. In 2022, total ODA expenditure amounted to approximately 29&nbsp;billion euros, of which only 0.7% was allocated to measures supporting good governance in the area of food security.</p>","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bmz.de/en\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development', 'En')\">Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.bmz.de/en\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development', 'En')\">Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bmz.de/en\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development', 'En')\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/bmz.png\" alt=\"Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border:transparent\"/></a>","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"<a href=\"https://www.bmel.de/EN/Home/home_node.html\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Regional Identity', 'En')\">Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Regional Identity</a>","source_organisation_2_short":"<a href=\"https://www.bmel.de/EN/Home/home_node.html\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Regional Identity', 'En')\">Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Regional Identity</a>","source_organisation_logo_2":"<a href=\"https://www.bmel.de/EN/Home/home_node.html\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Regional Identity', 'En')\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/bmleh.png\" alt=\"Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Regional Identity\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Regional Identity\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border:transparent\"/></a>","weather_active_1":true,"weather_indicator_1":"2.2 Unterst\u00fctzung guter Regierungsf\u00fchrung bei der Erreichung einer angemessenen Ern\u00e4hrung weltweit","weather_indicator_1_year_a":2022,"weather_indicator_1_year_b":2020,"weather_indicator_1_year_c":2018,"weather_indicator_1_year_d":2016,"weather_indicator_1_target":"Angemessene Steigerung des Anteils der ausgezahlten Mittel f\u00fcr die Anwendung von Leitlinien und Empfehlungen des VN-Weltern\u00e4hrungsausschusses (CFS) an den Gesamtausgaben f\u00fcr Ern\u00e4hrungssicherung in Prozent bis 2030","weather_indicator_1_target_1":"Angemessene Steigerung des Anteils der ausgezahlten Mittel f\u00fcr die Anwendung von Leitlinien und Empfehlungen des VN-Weltern\u00e4hrungsausschusses (CFS) an den Gesamtausgaben f\u00fcr Ern\u00e4hrungssicherung in % bis 2030","weather_indicator_1_target_1_category":"normal","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a":"Keine","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_title":"Keine Bewertung m\u00f6glich.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b":null,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b_title":null,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c":null,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c_title":null,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_d":null,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_d_title":null,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_d_valid":true,"data_show_map":false,"copyright":"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2025","data_footnotes":"The data is based on a special evaluation and is not publicly available.<br>\u2022 Due to methodological changes, the results from 2020 are only comparable with previous years to a limited extent.<br>\u2022 The guidelines and recommendations of the United Nations Committee on World Food Security (CFS) are not legally binding.","graph_title":"Disbursement made primarily to developing and newly emerging countries to support good governance in the context of efforts to promote food security","graph_subtitle":"Proportion of total expenditure on food security devoted to good governance","precision":[{"decimals":1.0}],"span_gaps":true,"show_line":true,"graph_type":"bar","data_start_values":[{"field":"Time series","value":"Support for good governance in attaining appropriate nutrition worldwide"}],"graph_stepsize":[{"step":5.0}],"graph_series_breaks":[{"value":3.0}],"rating":"","target_description":"The share of disbursed funds supporting good governance in food security in total food security expenditure should be increased.<br><br>\u2022 The current trend is moving contrary to the target.
