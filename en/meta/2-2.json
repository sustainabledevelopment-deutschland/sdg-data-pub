For this, a review of all project and programme documents on undertakings in the field of food security was carried out. There must be congruity with the recording of the related spending as official development assistance (<abbr title=\"Official development assistance\" tabindex=\"0\">ODA</abbr>). A project is counted if in the target of the impact matrix or project description a) the application of a guideline or recommendation of the Global Strategic Framework for Food Security is specifically mentioned or b) a key element with regard to the content of a guideline or recommendation is a substantial part of the undertaking and at the same time the undertaking aims to strengthen the legal, institutional or political framework.
