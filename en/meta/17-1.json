To live up to that responsibility, the Federal Government has committed itself to the target, originally set by the <abbr title=\"United Nations\" tabindex=\"0\">UN</abbr> General Assembly in 1970, of raising its <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\" tabindex=\"0\">ODA</abbr> expenditure to 0.7&nbsp;% of its <abbr title=\"Gross national income\" tabindex=\"0\">GNI</abbr>. For the indicator maintained in the German strategy for sustainable development, the aim is to reach that target by the year 2030.","data_state":"The data published in the indicator report 2022 is as of 31 October 2022.

Whether a flow is counted as <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\" tabindex=\"0\">ODA</abbr> is determined by guidelines issued by the <abbr title=\"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\" tabindex=\"0\">OECD</abbr> Development Assistance Committee (<abbr title=\"Development Assistance Committee\" tabindex=\"0\">DAC</abbr>). <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\" tabindex=\"0\">ODA</abbr> comprises public funds spent in order to advance the economic and social development of developing countries. It primarily includes expenditure for financial and technical cooperation with developing countries, humanitarian aid and development-cooperation contributions to multilateral institutions such as the United Nations, the European Union, the World Bank or regional development banks. Under certain conditions, spending on peace missions, debt relief and certain items of development expenditure in the donor country&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;such as tuition costs for students from developing countries, domestic spending on refugees and funding for development-related research&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;can also be counted as <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\" tabindex=\"0\">ODA</abbr>. The <abbr title=\"Development Assistance Committee\" tabindex=\"0\">DAC</abbr> also defines the list of developing countries eligible for <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\" tabindex=\"0\">ODA</abbr>. This includes the least developed countries (<abbr title=\"Least developed countries\" tabindex=\"0\">LDCs</abbr>) as well as other countries with low and medium per capita <abbr title=\"Gross national income\" tabindex=\"0\">GNI</abbr>. The list is consistently updated, such that changes in the indicator may therefore be the result of one or more countries being added to or removed from the list.<br><br>In 2018, there was a change in the way <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\" tabindex=\"0\">ODA</abbr> loans (<abbr title=\"that is to say (id est)\" tabindex=\"0\">i.e.</abbr> loans, bonds and debt reliefs) are evaluated, in that the previous net-flows principle was replaced by the grant-equivalent method. In this method, only the grant element of an <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\" tabindex=\"0\">ODA</abbr> loan is determined by the interest rate and duration, among others, and is counted as <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\" tabindex=\"0\">ODA</abbr>. The intention behind the new methodology is to make <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\" tabindex=\"0\">ODA</abbr> grants and <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\" tabindex=\"0\">ODA</abbr> loans comparable.<br><br>As calculated using the new method, Germany\u2019s <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\" tabindex=\"0\">ODA</abbr> came to 27.3&nbsp;billion euros (provisional results) in 2021, slightly higher than the 25.2&nbsp;billion euros recorded for 2020. <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\" tabindex=\"0\">ODA</abbr> in 2021&nbsp;accounted for 0.74&nbsp;% of Germany\u2019s <abbr title=\"Gross national income\" tabindex=\"0\">GNI</abbr> (2020: 0.73&nbsp;%). Hence, the target of 0.70&nbsp;% was reached in 2020&nbsp;and 2021. For comparison, net <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\" tabindex=\"0\">ODA</abbr> spending (using the evaluation method that was standard until 2017) came to around 26.6&nbsp;billion euros in 2021. While the <abbr title=\"Gross national income\" tabindex=\"0\">GNI</abbr> increased by a factor of 1.5&nbsp;compared to 2010, net <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\" tabindex=\"0\">ODA</abbr> trebled in the same period.<br><br>On the international scale, in 2021&nbsp;Germany was once again the second-largest contributor in absolute terms, after the United States and ahead of Japan (provisional figures). However, the <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\" tabindex=\"0\">ODA</abbr>-ratio for the United States was at 0.18&nbsp;% below the average of the <abbr title=\"Development Assistance Committee\" tabindex=\"0\">DAC</abbr> countries (0.33&nbsp;%). Germany had the fourth-highest ODA:GNI ratio among the 29&nbsp;members of the <abbr title=\"Development Assistance Committee\" tabindex=\"0\">DAC</abbr>. According to the provisional figures for 2021, the international target of 0.70&nbsp;% was met by four <abbr title=\"Development Assistance Committee\" tabindex=\"0\">DAC</abbr> countries: Luxembourg (0.99&nbsp;%), Norway (0.93&nbsp;%), Sweden (0.92&nbsp;%), and Denmark (0.70&nbsp;%).<br><br>In addition to official development cooperation, private funds are also provided by such organisations as churches, foundations and associations. These chiefly take the form of contributions and donations. This private development cooperation, which does not affect the <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\" tabindex=\"0\">ODA</abbr> figures, amounted to 1.3&nbsp;billion euros in 2020, the equivalent of a 0.04&nbsp;% share of <abbr title=\"Gross national income\" tabindex=\"0\">GNI</abbr>. Private direct investment in developing countries came to 1.9&nbsp;billion euros in 2020.","embedded_feature_html":"<p>Additional data series for the indicator can be found <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/AddInfos/en/17_1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" >here</a>.</p><br><small>Note: You can display the PDF document directly in your browser or download the PDF document and open it with a PDF reader of your choice.
