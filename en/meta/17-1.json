Since 2018, it has been calculated using the grant-equivalent method.","dns_indicator_intention":"Through their development cooperation, donor countries play a role in reducing global poverty, preventing humanitarian need, safeguarding peace, achieving democracy, making globalisation fair and protecting the environment. To live up to that responsibility, the German Government has committed itself to the target, originally set by the <abbr title=\"United Nations\">UN</abbr> General Assembly in 1970, of raising its <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\">ODA</abbr> expenditure to 0.7% of its <abbr title=\"Gross national income\">GNI</abbr>. For the indicator maintained in the German Sustainable Development Strategy, the aim is to reach that target by the year 2030.","data_state":"The data published in the indicator report 2022 is as of Oct 31 2022. The data shown on this platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/facts_publications/\">indicator report 2022</a>.","indicator_name":"Official development assistance as a proportion of gross national income","section":"Development cooperation","postulate":"Supporting sustainable development","target_id":"17.1.1","previous":"16-3-ab","next":"17-2","content_and_progress":"<b>Text from the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/facts_publications/\">Indicator Report 2021&nbsp;</a></b><br><br>The data on which the indicator is based are the statistics on German official development assistance which are compiled by the Federal Statistical Office on behalf of the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development. Whether a flow is counted as <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\">ODA</abbr> is determined by guidelines issued by the <abbr title=\"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\">OECD</abbr> Development Assistance Committee (<abbr title=\"Development Assistance Committee\">DAC</abbr>). <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\">ODA</abbr> comprises public funds spent in order to advance the economic and social development of developing countries. It primarily includes expenditure for financial and technical cooperation with developing countries, humanitarian aid and development-cooperation contributions to multilateral institutions such as the United Nations, the European Union, the World Bank or regional development banks. Under certain conditions, spending on peace missions, debt relief and certain items of development expenditure in the donor country&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;such as tuition costs for students from developing countries, domestic spending on refugees and funding for development-related research&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;can also be counted as <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\">ODA</abbr>.<br><br>The <abbr title=\"Development Assistance Committee\">DAC</abbr> also defines the list of developing countries eligible for <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\">ODA</abbr>. This includes the least developed countries (<abbr title=\"Least developed countries\">LDCs</abbr>) as well as other countries with low and medium per capita <abbr title=\"Gross national income\">GNI</abbr>. As a rule, the list is updated every three years. Changes in the indicator may therefore be the result of one or more countries being added to or removed from the list.<br><br>In 2018, there was a change in the way <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\">ODA</abbr> loans are evaluated, in that the previous net-flows principle was replaced by the grant-equivalent method. In this method, only the grant element of an <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\">ODA</abbr> loan, once calculated, is counted as <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\">ODA</abbr>. The intention behind the new methodology is to make <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\">ODA</abbr> grants and <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\">ODA</abbr> loans comparable.<br><br>As calculated using the new method, Germany\u2019s <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\">ODA</abbr> came to <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 21.6&nbsp;billion in 2019, slightly higher than the <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 21.2&nbsp;billion recorded for 2018. In both years, <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\">ODA</abbr> accounted for 0.61% of Germany\u2019s <abbr title=\"Gross national income\">GNI</abbr>. For comparison, net <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\">ODA</abbr> spending (using the evaluation method that was standard until 2017) came to around <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 21.5&nbsp;billion in 2019. This represented a 1% drop from the previous year\u2019s figure of <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 21.8&nbsp;billion.<br><br>On the international scale, in 2019&nbsp;Germany was once again the second-largest contributor in absolute terms, after the United States and ahead of the <abbr title=\"United Kingdom\">UK</abbr> (provisional figures). Germany\u2019s ODA: <abbr title=\"Gross national income\">GNI</abbr> ration of 0.61% was higher than the average for <abbr title=\"European Union\">EU</abbr> members of the <abbr title=\"Development Assistance Committee\">DAC</abbr>, which was 0.48% according to the provisional figures. Germany had the sixth-highest ODA: <abbr title=\"Gross national income\">GNI</abbr> ratio among the 29&nbsp;members of the <abbr title=\"Development Assistance Committee\">DAC</abbr>. According to the provisional figures for 2019, the international target of 0.7% was met by five <abbr title=\"Development Assistance Committee\">DAC</abbr> countries: Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and the <abbr title=\"United Kingdom\">UK</abbr>.<br><br>In addition to official development cooperation, private funds are also provided by such organisations as churches, foundations and associations.<br><br>These chiefly take the form of contributions and donations. This private development cooperation, which does not affect the <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\">ODA</abbr> figures, amounted to <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 1.36&nbsp;billion in 2019, the equivalent of a 0.04% share of <abbr title=\"Gross national income\">GNI</abbr>. Private direct investment in developing countries came to <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 10.2&nbsp;billion in 2019, according to the preliminary data.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/destatis.png\" alt=\"Federal Statistical Office\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Statistical Office\" style=\"height:60px;
