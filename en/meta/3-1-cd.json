This risk is not confined to smokers themselves. Non-smokers exposed to tobacco smoke are not just irritated by the smoke but can also fall ill from it. The Federal Government is pursuing the goal of reducing the percentage of adolescent smokers to 7% and that of all persons aged 15&nbsp;years and older to 19% by 2030.","data_state":"The data published in the indicator report 2022 is as of Oct 31 2022. The data shown on this platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/facts_publications/\">indicator report 2022</a>.","indicator_name":"Smoking rate among young people and adults","section":"Health and nutrition","postulate":"Living healthy longer","target_id":"3.1.1","previous":"3-1-ab","next":"3-1-e","content_and_progress":"<b>Text from the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/facts_publications/\">Indicator Report 2021&nbsp;</a></b><br><br>The data for adolescents are collected in surveys on substance consumption among adolescents and young adults which are conducted by means of telephone interviews by the Federal Centre for Health Education. The surveys initially took place at intervals of three to four years, but since 2001&nbsp;they have been conducted almost every year. In order to ensure that the data are comparable over time, they are weighted on the basis of gender, region and age. The data for years without surveys have been interpolated for inclusion in the time series. The random sample used in 2019&nbsp;comprised 7,000&nbsp;adolescents and young adults.<br><br>The data for adults is surveyed every four years as part of the microcensus conducted by the Federal Statistical Office. The data for years without surveys have been interpolated for inclusion in the time series for the indicator. The microcensus, which is a sample survey, covers 1% of the whole population and is the largest household survey in Germany and Europe. The responses to the questions regarding smoking habits are voluntary and were provided by 79% of respondents in 2017.<br><br>In the group of adolescents between 12&nbsp;and 17&nbsp;years of age, the proportion of smokers initially increased from 23.9% (1995) to 28.1% (1997&nbsp;and 2001), but then declined steadily to 5.6% (5.2% for adolescent girls, 6.0% of adolescent boys) by 2019. Provided that the trend of recent years is maintained, the target value set for 2030&nbsp;is already achieved.<br><br>In 2017, a total of 22.4% of the sample population above the age of 15&nbsp;indicated that they smoked occasionally or regularly. This compares with a figure of 28.3&nbsp;% for 1995&nbsp;and 1999. The smoking rate for adults, in other words, has shown only a slight decrease. If the average trend over the last five years is maintained, the target for this sub-indicator can also be achieved.<br><br>In 2017, 18.8% of all adult respondents aged 15&nbsp;years or older considered themselves regular smokers, while 3.7% smoked occasionally. The rate among women (18.6%) was significantly lower than for men (26.4%). While the proportion of women smokers has fallen by 2.9&nbsp;percentage points since 1995, the proportion of men who smoke has dropped by 9.2&nbsp;percentage points.<br><br>In 2017, 96.2% of the respondent smokers preferred cigarettes. The frequency of tobacco consumption is important when considering the threat to the health of individuals. A total of 10.8% of regular smokers, compared with 17.4% in 1995, fell into the category of heavy smokers with more than 20&nbsp;cigarettes a day, while 81.4% smoked 5&nbsp;to 20&nbsp;a day. Within these figures there were also differences between the sexes. Almost one in seven of the male regular cigarette smokers was a heavy smoker, but only one in thirteen of the female smokers.<br><br>Smoking poses a high but avoidable risk to health. In 2018, 4.8% of all deaths (3.4% among women, 6.3% among men) could be attributed to symptomatic diseases for smokers (lung, bronchial, laryngeal and tracheal cancers). In 2018, the average age of those who died of lung, bronchial, and tracheal cancers was 71.1&nbsp;years, which is more than seven years below the average age at death (78.4&nbsp;years). Lower smoking rates would therefore help reduce premature mortality.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bzga.de/home/bzga/\">Federal Centre for Health Education</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.bzga.de/home/bzga/\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Centre for Health Education</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bzga.de/home/bzga/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/bzga.png\" alt=\"Federal Centre for Health Education\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Centre for Health Education\" style=\"height:60px;
