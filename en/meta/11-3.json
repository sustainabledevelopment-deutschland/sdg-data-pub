Housing costs comprise rent and ancillary charges, energy costs and water bills as well as, in the case of home ownership, investments to maintain the value of a property and interest payments on associated loans.","dns_indicator_intention":"High housing costs place restrictions on households with regard to their other consumption choices. Housing expenses amounting to more than 40% of disposable household income are considered to be excessive. The share of people who live in households where more than 40% of disposable household income is spent on housing is therefore to be reduced to 13% by 2030.","data_state":"The data published in the indicator report 2022 is as of Oct 31 2022. The data shown on this platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/facts_publications/\">indicator report 2022</a>.","indicator_name":"Housing cost overload","section":"Housing","postulate":"Affordable housing for all","target_id":"11.3.1","previous":"11-2-c","next":"11-4","content_and_progress":"<b>Text from the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/facts_publications/\">Indicator Report 2021&nbsp;</a></b><br><br>The data used for this indicator come from the harmonised European statistics on income and living conditions (EU\u2011SILC). The indicator expresses housing costs relative to disposable household income. If a household is receiving housing benefits or comparable social benefits, such as social-security payments for accommodation and heating, these are also included in the calculations. These social benefits are not added to the income amount but are deducted from the housing costs, so that the burden of housing expenses on households that rely on housing-related social benefits is reduced or almost nullified.<br><br>The purchase of owner-occupied property is not included in housing costs. Other spending on measures to enhance the value of a property is not taken into account either&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;though it is not always possible to clearly differentiate such spending from value-maintaining expenditure, which does count as part of housing costs. In such cases, established assumptions are applied to simplify the calculation. Nor does the indicator take into account any additional costs associated with the geographical location. For instance, expenditure on travel from a person\u2019s place of residence to their workplace is not taken into account, although it is possible that the long commuting distance is the only reason that their housing costs remain below the 40% threshold.<br><br>By defining the threshold value as 40% of disposable household income, the indicator provides no information about average housing costs in absolute terms. If clusters emerge close to the threshold, even small alterations in the ratio of income to housing costs can cause major changes in the indicator. The indicator rose from 14.5% in 2010&nbsp;to a relatively constant 16% from 2011&nbsp;to 2016. In 2017, it went back down to the starting rate of 14.5%, before reducing further in 2018, to 14.2%, and yet further in 2019, when it reached 13.9%. The value is therefore lower than the level it started at in 2010. If the average trend recorded over the last five years continued, the goal set for 2030&nbsp;would be achieved.<br><br>With regard to the actual housing situation and disposable income, the indicator provides only a limited amount of meaningful information. After all, the calculation method means that households with high incomes and high expenditure on housing also appear to be overburdened. Meanwhile, the data show that it is people at risk of poverty&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;that is, those with less than 60% of the median equivalised income for the population&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;who are particularly affected by excessive housing costs. Some 42.2% of people at risk of poverty were overburdened by housing costs in 2010, rising to 54.4% by 2014. That figure then sank to 48.3% by 2019. In contrast, excessive housing costs affected a markedly smaller proportion of people considered not at risk of poverty. The 2019&nbsp;figure of 8.0% was lower than the 9.4% recorded in 2010&nbsp;and peak of 10.5% reached in 2011.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"www.dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/destatis.png\" alt=\"Federal Statistical Office\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Statistical Office\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","source_url_1":"https://www.destatis.de/Europa/EN/Topic/Population-Labour-Social-Issues/Social-issues-living-conditions/_node.html;jsessionid=B340DD00C6EEDC7477B2AD2B54E4BC40.live731#587120","source_url_text_1":"Housing cost overburden","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/home\">Eurostat</a>","source_organisation_2_short":"<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/home\" target=\"_blank\">Eurostat</a>","source_organisation_logo_2":"<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/home\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"www.dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/eurostat.png\" alt=\"Eurostat\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationEurostat\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","source_url_2":"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/ILC_LVHO07A/default/table?category=livcon.ilc.ilc_lv.ilc_lvho.ilc_lvho_hc","source_url_text_2":"Housing cost overburden rate - Eurostat table [ilc_lvho07a ]","weather_active_1":true,"weather_indicator_1":"11.3 Housing cost overload","weather_indicator_1_year_a":2019,"weather_indicator_1_year_b":2018,"weather_indicator_1_year_c":2017,"weather_indicator_1_year_d":2016,"weather_indicator_1_year_e":2015,"weather_indicator_1_target":"Reduce the proportion of people who are overburdened to 13% by 2030","weather_indicator_1_target_1":"Reduce the proportion of people who are overburdened to 13% by 2030","weather_indicator_1_target_1_category":"normal","weather_indicator_1_target_1_targetYear":2030,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_title":"If the trend from 2019 had continued, the target value would have been reached or missed by less than 5% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b_title":"If the trend from 2018 had continued, the target value would have been reached or missed by less than 5% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c_title":"If the trend from 2017 had continued, the target value would have been reached or missed by less than 5% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_d":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_d_title":"Although the indicator has in 2016 been moving in the desired direction toward the target, if the trend had to continued, the target would have been missed in the target year by more than 20% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_d_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_e":"Blitz","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_e_title":"In 2015 the distance to the target was constantly high or had increased.
