Gross domestic product (<abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\">GDP</abbr>) at current prices is determined as part of the national accounts by the Federal Statistical Office and published as a provisional figure in January of the following year. As part of the major revision of the national accounts in 2019&nbsp;the calculations underwent thorough review and revision. As a result, nominal <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\">GDP</abbr> figures are slightly lower on average than they were before the major revision of 2019. The overall economic picture, however, has remained largely unchanged.<br><br>The debt-to-<abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\">GDP</abbr> ratio is influenced by the state of the public budgets and by economic development in general. The indicator measures a stock, namely the volume of debt, against a flow, namely the value of <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\">GDP</abbr>. With this formula, if the level of debt is constant, the faster <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\">GDP</abbr> grows the more sharply the ratio will fall. In the event of an economic upswing, then, the debt-to-<abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\">GDP</abbr> ratio will fall even if absolute total public debt does not. Conversely, the debt ratio may rise even though absolute debt decreases if <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\">GDP</abbr> falls faster than the volume of debt.<br><br>The indicator, moreover, does not include implicit government debt, in other words future financial commitments for which funds are yet to be disbursed.<br><br>Between 2003&nbsp;and 2018, Germany\u2019s debt-to-<abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\">GDP</abbr> ratio was above the prescribed <abbr title=\"European Union\">EU</abbr>-wide reference level. Following budgetary consolidation measures, the ratio fell from 67.3% in 2005&nbsp;to 64.0% in 2007, but then it rose again to peak at 82.3% in 2010. This increase must be seen in the context of the financial and economic crisis. In that period, Germany\u2019s public debt rose by <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 511&nbsp;billion from <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 1,600&nbsp;billion to <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 2,111&nbsp;billion.<br><br>Over the last eight years the debt ratio steadily declined, reaching 59.6% in 2019, the first year since 2002&nbsp;in which it had fallen below the 60% reference value prescribed by the Maastricht Treaty. The German Bundesbank, however, expects that government debt will have increased sharply in 2020&nbsp;as a result of the <abbr title=\"Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2\">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;pandemic and that the debt ratio will again have risen considerably higher than the reference value. This development has not yet been factored into the current status calculation and so has had no bearing on the displayed weather symbol. A valid assessment will not be possible until the figures for 2020&nbsp;have been disseminated.<br><br>The Federal Government reduced its debt for the first time in 2015, lowering it by <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 24.3&nbsp;billion to <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 1,372&nbsp;billion. In 2019, the volume of federal debt stood at about <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 1,299&nbsp;billion. The debts of the L\u00e4nder fell from their high point in 2012&nbsp;by <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 75.1&nbsp;billion to <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 609&nbsp;billion in 2019. Local government debt had continued to fall since 2017, reaching <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 165&nbsp;billion in 2019. Between 2010&nbsp;and 2019&nbsp;the social insurance funds were able to reduce their debts by <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 651&nbsp;million to <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 695&nbsp;million. Of the total amount of government debt in 2019, about 62.6% was federal debt, while some 29.4% was owed by the L\u00e4nder and 8.0% by local government.<br><br>In the balance sheet, government debts are balanced against assets, both financial and non-financial. The largest items on the assets side are state-owned infrastructural properties, such as roads, schools and public buildings. According to the balance sheet drawn up by the Federal Statistical Office, these assets had a written-down value of <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 1,418&nbsp;billion in 2018. Financial assets were valued in 2018&nbsp;at <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 1,291&nbsp;billion. Securities are the largest of the financial assets.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bundesbank.de/en\">German Federal Bank</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.bundesbank.de/en\" target=\"_blank\">German Federal Bank</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bundesbank.de/en\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://dnsUpgradeEnvironment.github.io/dns-indicators/public/OrgImgEn/bundesbank.png\" alt=\"German Federal Bank\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationGerman Federal Bank\" style=\"height:60px;
