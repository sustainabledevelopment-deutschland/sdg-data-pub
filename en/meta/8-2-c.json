The <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr> at current prices is determined by the Federal Statistical Office as part of the national accounts system.<br><br>The debt-to-<abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr> ratio is influenced by the state of the public budgets and by economic development in general. According to the formula&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;assuming stable debt&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;the debt ratio falls faster the stronger <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr> growth. On the other hand, the debt-to-<abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr> ratio can increase, if the <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr> shows a stronger decline than the absolute debt in the same period of time. Furthermore, the indicator excludes implicit government debt, which refers to the government\u2019s future payment obligations that are pledged but not yet due.<br><br>Between 2003&nbsp;and 2018, Germany\u2019s debt-to-<abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr> ratio was above the prescribed <abbr title=\"European Union\" tabindex=\"0\">EU</abbr>-wide reference level. Following budgetary consolidation measures, the ratio fell from 67.5&nbsp;% in 2005&nbsp;to 64.2&nbsp;% in 2007, but then it rose again to peak at 82.0&nbsp;% in 2010. This increase must be seen in the context of the financial and economic crisis. Since 2012, Germany\u2019s public debt-to-<abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr> ratio steadily decreased to a value of 58.9&nbsp;% in 2019&nbsp;and, thus, dropped below the reference level of 60&nbsp;% determined by the Maastricht Treaty for the first time. Due to the <abbr title=\"Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2\" tabindex=\"0\">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;pandemic, the debt-to-<abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr> ratio increased significantly and reached 68.0&nbsp;% in 2020&nbsp;and 68.6&nbsp;% in 2021.<br><br>In 2021, the debt-to-<abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr> ratio of 13&nbsp;<abbr title=\"European Union\" tabindex=\"0\">EU</abbr>-states fell below the reference value of 60&nbsp;%. The <abbr title=\"European Union\" tabindex=\"0\">EU</abbr>-average was 87.9&nbsp;% in the respective year. The highest debt-to-<abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr> ratio were measured for Greece (194.5&nbsp;%) and Italy (150.3&nbsp;%); the lowest for Estonia (17.6&nbsp;%).<br><br>Consolidated debt of the state steadily increased since 1991, however, it reduced in 2013&nbsp;for the first time and constantly decreased from 2015&nbsp;on. In 2019, the consolidated debt of the overall public budget was 2,047&nbsp;billion euros. In consequence of the <abbr title=\"Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2\" tabindex=\"0\">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;pandemic, the consolidated debt increased to 2,472&nbsp;billion euros in 2021&nbsp;and, thus, reached its peak since 1991. Germany\u2019s debt per capita increased in 2021&nbsp;to 29,708&nbsp;euros; in 1991, the value was at 7,730&nbsp;euros.<br><br>Non-consolidated debt amounted to 2,486&nbsp;billion euros in 2021. Of the total amount of government debt in the respective year, about 67.0&nbsp;% was federal debt, while some 26.7&nbsp;% was owed by the L\u00e4nder and 6.3&nbsp;% by local government. The debt of the social insurance amounted to 392&nbsp;million euros (0.0&nbsp;%).<br><br>In the national balance of assets, the government debt is balanced by its assets&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;both tangible and financial. According to the national wealth accounts compiled by the Federal Statistical Office, fixed assets were valued (after amortisation) at 1,509&nbsp;billion euros in 2020. The biggest asset owned by the government is its buildings and structures (roads, schools, public buildings) at a value of 1,284&nbsp;billion euros, accounting for more than a third of the total assets of the state (34.4&nbsp;%). The financial assets were valued at 1,555&nbsp;billion euros (2020).
