A distinction is made between Financial Cooperation (FC) and Technical Cooperation (TC). Financial cooperation includes favourable loans, equity capital or grants that do not have to be repaid. Technical cooperation services are primarily advisory services, but to a limited extent also the supply of material goods, the construction of facilities as well as studies and expert opinions.","dns_political_intention":"The economic participation of girls and women in developing and emerging countries is to be increased. To this end, the number of girls and women in developing and emerging countries who obtain vocational qualifications through German development cooperation is to be gradually increased by one third over the period from 2015&nbsp;to 2030. The Federal Government as part of the G7&nbsp;summit is obliged to support girl\u2019s and women\u2019s education since 2015.","political_target":"Gradual increase by one third by 2030&nbsp;compared to 2015&nbsp;as the base year","type_target":"Target with specific target value","data_state":"16/05/2022","indicator_name":"Vocational qualifications for women and girls through German development cooperation","section":"Equality","postulate":"Strengthening the economic participation of women globally","target_id":"5.1.2","previous":"5-1-e","next":"5-1-g","content_and_progress":"<p><b style= \"color: #ff3a21; font-size: large\">5.1.f Vocational qualifications for women and girls through German development cooperation</b><br><br>The data source for the indicator on the vocational qualification of women and girls through German development cooperation is information provided by the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) on development initiatives that were in the implementation phase in the respective reporting year. This includes all short-, medium-, and long-term formal and non-formal vocational training measures in developing and emerging countries. These measures are fully financed through federal and market-based funds.<br><br>Data on this indicator was first collected in 2015&nbsp;on behalf of the BMZ by the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH and the Centrum f\u00fcr Evaluation (CeVal GmbH). A subsequent data collection took place in 2018. Since 2021, data has been derived every three years from the so-called aggregated results reporting by GIZ and the KfW Development Bank (KfW).<br><br>In 2015, approximately 355,000&nbsp;women and girls were reached through vocational qualification measures, while in 2018&nbsp;the number increased to around 863,000. The high number in 2018&nbsp;was primarily due to cooperation with China. As this cooperation in the education sector has since ended, the number of women and girls reached in 2021&nbsp;was only about 80,000. Compared to 2015&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;the first year of data collection&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;this corresponds to just over one fifth of the women and girls who received vocational training as part of German development cooperation in developing and emerging countries.<br><br>The number of women and girls reached does not allow any conclusions to be drawn regarding the success, scope, or quality of the respective development measures. Of the approximately 80,000&nbsp;women and girls reached, an estimated 79.3% were supported through Technical Cooperation (TC) and 20.7% through Financial Cooperation (FC). While figures for TC are collected ex post, data for FC is gathered in advance based on estimates. As a result, overestimations and multiple counting may occur.</p>","download_content":"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/indicator_downloads_en/5-1-f.pdf","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bmz.de/en\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development', 'En')\">Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.bmz.de/en\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development', 'En')\">Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bmz.de/en\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development', 'En')\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/bmz.png\" alt=\"Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development\" style=\"height:60px;
