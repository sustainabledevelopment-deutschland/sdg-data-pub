This includes all short-, medium-, and long-term formal and non-formal vocational training measures in developing and emerging countries. These measures are fully financed through federal and market-based funds.<br><br>Data on this indicator was first collected in 2015&nbsp;on behalf of the <abbr title=\"Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development\" tabindex=\"0\">BMZ</abbr> by the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (<abbr title=\"German Agency for International Cooperation\" tabindex=\"0\">GIZ</abbr>) <abbr title=\"Company with limited liability\" tabindex=\"0\">GmbH</abbr> and the Centrum f\u00fcr Evaluation (CeVal <abbr title=\"Company with limited liability\" tabindex=\"0\">GmbH</abbr>). A subsequent data collection took place in 2018.
