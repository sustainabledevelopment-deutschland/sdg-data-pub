A <i>fish stock</i> refers to a self-reproducing population of a fish species. Accordingly, a single species may consist of multiple stocks, each subject to different catch reference levels. The stock reference values are calculated by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES).<br><br>Data collection for calculating the indicator encompasses the entire North Sea and Baltic Sea; therefore, a separate reporting for German territorial waters or the German exclusive economic zone is not possible. The annual determination of sustainable catch limits is based on stochastic forecasting models that rely on the historical development of the stocks. Data on landed quantities are derived from reported catches. Additionally, samples provide information on demographic parameters of the stock, such as the age and size of fish. These are supplemented by fishery-independent scientific surveys conducted on research vessels. The underlying time series is updated annually; the fish species considered may also be retrospectively adjusted, which can lead to revisions of indicator values for previous years.<br><br>In 2023, the proportion of sustainably fished stocks among all stocks assessed according to the MSY approach in the North and Baltic Seas combined was 71.4%. In the North Sea, the proportion was 70.4%, and in the Baltic Sea, 75.0%. Between 2018&nbsp;and 2023, an overall positive trend is evident. The politically established target is to sustainably manage all economically exploited fish stocks in accordance with the MSY approach by 2030. However, if the current trend continues, this target is likely to be narrowly missed.<br><br>The assessment of the indicator is challenging for several reasons. Besides the actual stock development, the selection of stocks under assessment influences the indicator values. This complicates comparability between years, as the basis for assessment may change. Not all fish stocks are examined for sustainable management. Therefore, the proportion of sustainably managed stocks should always be considered relative to the total number of economically exploited fish stocks. While the aim is to include as many stocks as possible in the assessments, a complete coverage&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;particularly of economically less relevant or lightly fished stocks&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;is unrealistic due to the high effort and costs involved.<br><br>Currently, 58&nbsp;stocks are economically exploited in the North Sea and 20&nbsp;in the Baltic Sea. Of these, 27&nbsp;stocks in the North Sea and eight in the Baltic Sea are assessed based on the MSY approach&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;accounting for approximately 45% of the exploited stocks. Stocks for which sufficient data for an MSY analysis are lacking are excluded from the indicator. It should also be noted when interpreting the indicator that the recommended catch limits apply across borders and can only be indirectly influenced by individual states.</p>","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/institutions-bodies/european-commission_en\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the European Commission', 'En')\">European Commission</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/institutions-bodies/european-commission_en\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the European Commission', 'En')\">European Commission</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/institutions-bodies/european-commission_en\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the European Commission', 'En')\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/europeancommission.png\" alt=\"European Commission\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationEuropean Commission\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border:transparent\"/></a>","source_url_1":"https://stecf.jrc.ec.europa.eu/reports/cfp-monitoring_en","source_url_text_1":"STECF - Reports","source_url_alert_1":"the European Commission","weather_active_1":true,"weather_indicator_1":"14.1.b Share of sustainably fished stocks of fish in the North and Baltic Seas","weather_indicator_1_year_a":2023,"weather_indicator_1_year_b":2022,"weather_indicator_1_year_c":2021,"weather_indicator_1_year_d":2020,"weather_indicator_1_year_e":2019,"weather_indicator_1_year_f":2018,"weather_indicator_1_year_g":2017,"weather_indicator_1_year_h":2016,"weather_indicator_1_year_i":2015,"weather_indicator_1_year_j":2014,"weather_indicator_1_target":"The share of sustainably managed fish stocks in the North and Baltic Sea in all MSY-examined stocks is to rise to 100 per cent by 2030","weather_indicator_1_target_1":"All fish stocks used for commercial purpos-es to be sustainably managed in accordance with the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) approach by 2020","weather_indicator_1_target_1_category":"normal","weather_indicator_1_target_1_targetYear":2020,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a":null,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_title":"No evaluation possible.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_valid":false,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b":null,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b_title":"No evaluation possible.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b_valid":false,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c":"Ende","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c_title":"Assessment ended.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c_valid":false,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_d":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_d_title":"Although the indicator has in 2020 been moving in the desired direction toward the target, if the trend had to continued, the target would have been missed in the target year by more than 20% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_d_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_e":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_e_title":"Although the indicator has in 2019 been moving in the desired direction toward the target, if the trend had to continued, the target would have been missed in the target year by more than 20% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_e_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_f":"Blitz","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_f_title":"In 2018 the distance to the target was constantly high or had increased.
