The main criterion applied to differentiate between <abbr title=\"Research and development\" tabindex=\"0\">R&D</abbr> and related activities is whether the activity involves an appreciable element of newness or further development.<br><br>The share of research and development expenditure in the gross domestic product (<abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr>) is determined annually by the Federal Statistical Office. Overall expenditure on research and development comprises expenditure by general government (including non-profit private research institutions), institutions of higher education, and businesses. The surveys and calculations adhere to the recommended methodologies of the Frascati Manual of the <abbr title=\"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\" tabindex=\"0\">OECD</abbr> on statistics about <abbr title=\"Research and development\" tabindex=\"0\">R&D</abbr>, which also enable international comparisons.<br><br>Overall <abbr title=\"Research and development\" tabindex=\"0\">R&D</abbr> expenditure in Germany in 2020&nbsp;amounted to 106.6&nbsp;billion euros, equivalent to 3.1&nbsp;% of <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr>. Hence, the indicator was 0.4&nbsp;percentage points below the annual target of 3.5&nbsp;% of <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr> by 2025.
