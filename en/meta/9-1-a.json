The higher the spending, the greater the likelihood of more dynamic gains in productivity, stronger economic growth and improved competitiveness.

The main criterion that differentiates <abbr title=\"Research and development\">R&D</abbr> from related activities is the existence of an appreciable element of novelty or advancement from a previous position.<br><br>The Federal Statistical Office annually calculates how much has been spent on research and development as a proportion of gross domestic product. Overall spending on research and development comprises expenditure by the public sector (including private non-profit research institutions), businesses and institutions of higher education. The data-gathering and calculations adhere to the recommended methodologies of the <abbr title=\"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\">OECD</abbr> Frascati Manual on statistics about research and development, which enables international comparisons.<br><br>Overall <abbr title=\"Research and development\">R&D</abbr> expenditure in Germany in 2018&nbsp;amounted to <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 104.7&nbsp;billion, equivalent to 3.1% of <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\">GDP</abbr>. It was thus 0.4&nbsp;percentage points below the target set for 2025&nbsp;of at least 3.5% of <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\">GDP</abbr> annually. The intended target has not been reached.<br><br>Since 2000, spending on research and development in Germany has risen by about 0.7&nbsp;percentage points as a proportion of <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\">GDP</abbr>. The indicator has shown the strongest growth since 2007. While the figure increased by an average of 0.01&nbsp;percentage points per annum between 2000&nbsp;and 2007, it grew by an annual 0.06&nbsp;percentage points on average from 2007&nbsp;until 2018.<br><br>As an international comparison, Germany is ahead of the United States with its 2.8% and the <abbr title=\"European Union consisting of 28&nbsp;member states\">EU-28</abbr>&nbsp;region with its 2.0%. On the other hand, several countries are ahead of Germany, including Sweden and Japan (both at 3.3%).<br><br>In 2018, the private sector accounted for by far the largest share of <abbr title=\"Research and development\">R&D</abbr> expenditure in Germany at 68.9%, with 17.6% spent by institutions of higher education and a further 13.5% by public and private non-profit research institutions. Staff employed in <abbr title=\"Research and development\">R&D</abbr> comprised around 708,000&nbsp;full-time equivalents, a figure that includes only the share of their working hours actually spent on <abbr title=\"Research and development\">R&D</abbr> work.
