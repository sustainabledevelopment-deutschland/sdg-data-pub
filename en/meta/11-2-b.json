The data record fuel consumption associated with passenger transport within Germany, irrespective of where refuelling takes place (in accordance with the principle of actual final consumption). \u201cFinal energy\u201d refers to that part of the total energy used that is directly consumed in transport, so it excludes transformation losses that arise during the production of fuels as well as any pipeline losses that may occur.<br><br>The volume of passenger transport is expressed in terms of the number of passenger-kilometres travelled. Provided by <abbr title=\"Transport Emission Model\" tabindex=\"0\">TREMOD</abbr>, this figure is used to calculate the specific level of energy consumption in this sector. In the aviation statistics, only domestic flights are taken into account. International flights departing from or landing in German territory are not counted. Nor is waterborne passenger transport included.<br><br>Some 27.2&nbsp;% of overall final energy consumption can be attributed to transport. Of this, 65.3&nbsp;%<sup>1</sup> is accounted for by passenger transport. Savings in final energy consumption in passenger transport therefore have a marked effect on total energy consumption in Germany. The number of passenger-kilometres provides information about the extent to which transport intensity (changes of rail or air passenger numbers per kilometres travelled) changes. In addition to final energy consumption, the indicator also examines energy efficiency in passenger transport, measured in terms of energy consumption per passenger-kilometre.<br><br>Final energy consumption in passenger transport decreased by a total of 14.5&nbsp;% in the period from 2005&nbsp;to 2020. Thus, final energy consumption in passenger transport is currently developing in a direction which supports the goal of the German strategy for sustainable development.<br><br>Also the number of passenger-kilometres covered decreased by 14.3&nbsp;% between 2005&nbsp;and 2020, such that energy consumption in all forms of transport increased only slightly by 0.2&nbsp;% to 1.63&nbsp;megajoules per passenger-kilometre<sup>2</sup> during the same period. Consequently, efficiency in passenger transport could not be increased. This is essentially because of major restrictions to mobility during the <abbr title=\"Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2\" tabindex=\"0\">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;pandemic. Both energy consumption and transportation volume reduced for rail, air and road transport. Thus, the road transport slightly increased in efficiency by 1.1&nbsp;%, while efficiency in rail and air transport decreased by 13.7&nbsp;% and 56.7&nbsp;%, respectively. The decline in efficiency for rail and air transport can be attributed to lesser train and airplane occupancy during the <abbr title=\"Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2\" tabindex=\"0\">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;pandemic.<br><br>Private motorised transport by car or two-wheeled vehicle accounted for 86.1&nbsp;% of total passenger transport volumes in 2020. Its share in 2019&nbsp;was 80.3&nbsp;%. It can be subdivided into various categories. In 2019&nbsp;(more recent figures not yet available), work-related transport, <abbr title=\"that is to say (id est)\" tabindex=\"0\">i.e.</abbr> commuter traffic and business travel, accounted for the largest share, at 36.6&nbsp;%, followed by recreational transport at 30.9&nbsp;%. Travel for shopping accounted for 17.5&nbsp;%. These purpose-based categories of transport have developed differently since 2005. Work-related travel in particularly has increased significantly (+&nbsp;19.0&nbsp;%), while journeys for recreation or shopping have declined (- 8.9&nbsp;% and &#8209; 2.1&nbsp;% respectively).<br><br><small><sup>1</sup> The sum of shares of goods transport (indicator 11.2.a) and passenger transport (indicator 11.2.b) in proportion to total final energy consumption in transport do not add up to 100&nbsp;%. This discrepancy is caused by different definitions of energy consumption in passenger and goods transport (domestic consumption; source: <abbr title=\"Transport Emission Model\" tabindex=\"0\">TREMOD</abbr>) and total final energy consumption in traffic (domestic sales; source: AG Energiebilanzen).<br><br><sup>2</sup> For a better understanding: the heating value of a litre gasoline is equivalent to 32&nbsp;megajoules. Hence, the consumption of 1.63&nbsp;megajoules per passenger kilometre corresponds to the energy content of 5.1&nbsp;litre gasoline (extrapolated to 100&nbsp;km).</small></p>","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.ifeu.de/en/\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research', 'En')\">Institute for Energy and Environmental Research</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.ifeu.de/en/\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research', 'En')\">Institute for Energy and Environmental Research</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.ifeu.de/en/\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research', 'En')\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/ifeu.png\" alt=\"Institute for Energy and Environmental Research\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationInstitute for Energy and Environmental Research\" style=\"height:60px;
