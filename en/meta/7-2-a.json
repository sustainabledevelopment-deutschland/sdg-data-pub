Furthermore, their utilisation is associated with the emission of greenhouse gases.

Gross final energy consumption comprises the total energy consumption by end users, transmission losses, and own consumption in energy production. It includes both domestically generated and imported energy carriers.<br><br>The indicator is calculated by the Working Group on Renewable Energy Statistics (AGEE-Stat). The calculation is carried out in accordance with the reporting requirements of the European Union\u2019s Renewable Energy Directive (Directive 2009/28/EC until 2020, Directive 2018/2001&nbsp;from 2021&nbsp;onwards), which stipulates the use of multi-year averages for sources such as hydropower and wind energy due to natural fluctuations in availability. The politically established target of achieving an 18% share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption by 2020&nbsp;was exceeded, with a recorded share of 19.1%. In 2024, the share of renewable energy reached 22.4%. If the current trend continues, the next target&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;41% by 2030&nbsp;(as defined in the National Energy and Climate Plan, NECP, August 2024)&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;is expected to be clearly missed.<br><br>However, from a long-term perspective, the value of this indicator has risen significantly from 7.2% in 2005. The use of renewable energy varies considerably by sector. In 2024, renewables accounted for 54.4% of gross electricity consumption, 18.1% of final energy consumption for heating and cooling, and 7.2% in the transport sector.<br><br>The indicator is closely
