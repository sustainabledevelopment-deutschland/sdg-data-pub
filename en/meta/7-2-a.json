Gross final energy consumption covers energy consumption by end consumers and transmission losses as well as the self-consumption of the energy generation sector.","dns_indicator_intention":"The reserves of fossil fuels such as oil and gas are limited, and their use is associated with greenhouse gas emissions. Switching to renewable energies (natural energy sources that constantly regenerate) serves to reduce energy-related emissions and hence the extent of climate change. In addition, dependency on energy imports and the consumption of resources is reduced as well as technical innovations are promoted. For this reason, the goal of the Federal Government is to increase the share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption to 18&nbsp;% by 2020, to 30&nbsp;% by 2030, to 45&nbsp;% by 2040&nbsp;and to 60&nbsp;% by 2050.","dns_indicator_definition_new":"Der Indikator stellt den Anteil erneuerbarer Energien am Bruttoendenergieverbrauch (in Prozent) dar.

Besides renewables, these sources also include imported electricity and fossil fuels such as coal and lignite, oil and gas.<br><br>The indicator is calculated by <abbr title=\"Working Group on Renewable Energy Statistics\" tabindex=\"0\">AGEE-Stat</abbr>, the Working Group on Renewable Energy Statistics. In contrast to the reporting under the Renewable Energy Directive of the European Union (Directive 2009/28/EC), uses an average value for hydro and wind power over several years to smoothen the effects of varying supply, this indicator takes account of the volumes of electricity actually generated from wind and hydro power (German Government Energy Concept).<br><br>With regard to the method used to calculate the indicator, it should be noted that imports and exports of electricity are not included in full in the consumption of energy from renewable sources, whereas they are factored into gross final energy consumption. Accordingly, the indicator may overstate or understate the ratio of energy from renewable sources to gross final energy consumption, depending on the balance of trade. If there were an export surplus for electricity&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;as has been the case since 2001&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;the actual percentage of renewables in the energy mix would be lower than the level represented by the indicator.<br><br>The intended share of renewable energies in gross final energy consumption for 2020&nbsp;was achieved by 19.7&nbsp;%. Thus, the target value of 18&nbsp;% by 2020&nbsp;was exceeded. In 2021, the share of renewable energies decreased to 19.2&nbsp;% and is not heading towards the upcoming target value of 30&nbsp;% by 2030. However, the indicator shows a significant increase long-term (2005: 7.1&nbsp;%).<br><br>The use of renewables varies widely between sectors. In 2021, the share accounted for 41.1&nbsp;% of gross electricity generation, 16.5&nbsp;% of final energy consumption for heating and cooling and 6.8&nbsp;% in the transport sector. Among renewable energies, biomass, with a share of 58.0&nbsp;% and wind power, which accounts for 24.0&nbsp;%, play the greatest part in primary energy consumption in 2020&nbsp;(more recent data was not available at the time of going to press).<br><br>The indicator has cross-references to indicators 3.2.a \u201cEmissions of air pollutants\u201d, 7.2.b \u201cShare of electricity from renewable sources in gross electricity consumption\u201d and 13.1.a \u201cGreenhouse gas emissions\u201d.</p>","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a
