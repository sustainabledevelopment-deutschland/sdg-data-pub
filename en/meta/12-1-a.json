Not only do their purchasing decisions influence their own ongoing impact on the environment, as energy-efficient vehicles or insulated homes require less energy to use and lead to lower emissions of greenhouse gases, but consumers can also purchase products that have been manufactured in particularly sustainable ways. The aim of the German Government is therefore to increase the market share of products certified by publicly managed ecolabelling schemes to 34% by 2030.","data_state":"The data published in the indicator report 2022 is as of Oct 31 2022. The data shown on this platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/facts_publications/\">indicator report 2022</a>.","indicator_name":"Market share of products certified by publicly managed eco-labelling schemes","section":"Sustainable consumption","postulate":"Making consumption environmentally and socially compatible","target_id":"12.1.1","previous":"11-4","next":"12-1-b","content_and_progress":"<b>Text from the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/facts_publications/\">Indicator Report 2021&nbsp;</a></b><br><br>The indicator is calculated on the basis of data from the consumer research institute <abbr title=\"Consumer research institute\">GfK</abbr>, the Federal Motor Transport Authority, the agricultural market information firm AMI, the Organic Food Production Alliance, the sustainable-mobility association Verkehrsclub Deutschland and the Federal Environment Agency. The latter has been calculating the indicator values for each reporting year since 2012.<br><br>The indicator is made up of the market share of products which either bear the highest category of <abbr title=\"European Union\">EU</abbr> energy label within their class or are certified by the <abbr title=\"European Union\">EU</abbr> Ecolabel, the Euro-leaf organic logo or the German Blue Angel. The <abbr title=\"European Union\">EU</abbr> energy label primarily addresses energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, while the other three ecolabels also take into account other threats to the environment such as pesticide use and harmful wastewater. The indicator is intended to show whether environmentally friendly product variants are replacing conventional ones in the market. Only a selection of product groups are examined, in part because limited data are available on turnover for products bearing sustainability labels. This also makes it possible to avoid certain products being counted more than once.<br><br>The indicator encompasses consumption in the fields of home life, mobility and nutrition. Household appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines, televisions and vacuum cleaners are assessed, as are light bulbs, foodstuffs, sanitary paper, detergents and cars. Since the markets for the individual product groups are of different sizes, the market shares are weighted according to the total turnover of the market in question. This is intended to prevent the indicator being distorted by products which have high shares of small niche markets. Furthermore, this means expenditure on environmentally friendly products can be considered in relation to the total expenditure of private households.<br><br>It is not possible to weight the market shares according to the market relevance of the respective product groups because the environmental labels address different categories (energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, material demand) that cannot be balanced against one another. This also makes it impossible to set out the environmental footprint, or comprehensive evaluation taking in several environmental categories, of each product group. Moreover, the indicator only covers goods newly brought into circulation in relation to the market as a whole. It thereby gives no indication as to whether the enhanced efficiency of an appliance results in a change in consumer behaviour and perhaps to an increase in consumption&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;the rebound effect. It also describes the market share on the basis of turnover. Given the price differences between products with and without the relevant ecolabels, this means no conclusions can be drawn about their numbers. It follows that a change in the indicator value might have been caused by price alterations within a product group.<br><br>Between 2012&nbsp;and 2018, the market share of products certified by publicly managed ecolabelling schemes increased from 3.6% to 7.5%. This is equivalent to a turnover of <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 23.8&nbsp;billion in 2018. The indicator value sank in 2017&nbsp;and 2018&nbsp;relative to the previous year, which is not the desired direction of travel. Unless the trend is reversed and the market share is considerably increased, Germany will fall short of the 2030&nbsp;target.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en\">German Environment Agency</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en\" target=\"_blank\">German Environment Agency</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/uba.png\" alt=\"German Environment Agency\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationGerman Environment Agency\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","source_url_1":"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en/indicator-environmentally-friendly-consumption","source_url_text_1":"Weighted market shares by sales of products with official eco-labels","weather_active_1":true,"weather_indicator_1":"12.1.a Market share of products certified by publicly managed eco-labelling schemes","weather_indicator_1_year_a":2019,"weather_indicator_1_year_b":2018,"weather_indicator_1_year_c":2017,"weather_indicator_1_target":"Increase the market share to 34% by 2030","weather_indicator_1_target_1":"Increase the market share to 34% by 2030","weather_indicator_1_target_1_category":"normal","weather_indicator_1_target_1_targetYear":2030,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_title":"Although the indicator has in 2019 been moving in the desired direction toward the target, if the trend had to continued, the target would have been missed in the target year by more than 20% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b_title":"Although the indicator has in 2018 been moving in the desired direction toward the target, if the trend had to continued, the target would have been missed in the target year by more than 20% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c_title":"Although the indicator has in 2017 been moving in the desired direction toward the target, if the trend had to continued, the target would have been missed in the target year by more than 20% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c_valid":true,"graph_target_points":[{"type":"box","xMin":7.6865,"xMax":8.3135,"yMin":0,"yMax":34,"borderColor":"#bf8b2e","backgroundColor":"transparent","borderDash":[1,0],"borderWidth":2,"preset":"target_points"},{"type":"label","xValue":8,"yValue":37.0,"backgroundColor":"transparent","content":["Target:","34"],"font":{"size":14},"borderColor":"transparent"}],"data_show_map":false,"copyright":"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2022","graph_title":"Market share of products certified by publicly managed sustainability labelling schemes","graph_annotations":[{"value":34,"label":{"content":"Target 2030","position":"left","backgroundColor":"transparent","color":"transparent"},"preset":"target_line","borderColor":"transparent"}],"precision":[{"decimals":1.0}],"span_gaps":true,"show_line":true,"graph_type":"bar","data_start_values":[{"field":"Time series","value":"Market share of products certified by publicly managed eco-labelling schemes"}],"graph_limits":[{"minimum":0.0,"maximum":50.0}],"graph_stepsize":[{"step":5.0}],"national_geographical_coverage":"Germany","page_content":"\n\n<div>\n  <div class=\"my-header\">\n    <label class=\"default\">Products certified by eco-labelling schemes: increase the market share to 34% by 2030\n      <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/status\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/Wettersymbole/Wolke.png\" title=\"Although the indicator has in 2019 been moving in the desired direction toward the target, if the trend had to continued, the target would have been missed in the target year by more than 20% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.\" alt=\"Weathersymbol: cloud\"/>\n      </a>\n    </label>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"my-header-note\">\n  <label class=\"default\"><b>(Evaluation of the indicator report 2022 relating to the reporting year 2019)\n  </b></label>\n</div>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-30","national_data_updated_date":"2022-11-28","indicator_number":"12.1.a","target_number":"12.1","goal_number":"12","language":"en"}
