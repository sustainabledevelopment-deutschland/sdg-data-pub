The target is therefore to bring the number of recorded criminal offences per 100,000&nbsp;inhabitants down to less than 6,500&nbsp;by 2030.","data_state":"The data published in the indicator report 2022 is as of Oct 31 2022. The data shown on this platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/facts_publications/\">indicator report 2022</a>.","indicator_name":"Criminal offences","section":"Crime","postulate":"Further increasing personal security","target_id":"16.1.1","previous":"15-3-ab","next":"16-2","content_and_progress":"<b>Text from the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/facts_publications/\">Indicator Report 2021&nbsp;</a></b><br><br>The indicator covers all criminal offences recorded in the Police Crime Statistics. These are criminal offences reported to and fully processed by the police, except offences against the security of the state, traffic offences and administrative offences.<br><br>Criminal offences committed outside the Federal Republic of Germany are not included, nor are offences that are not within the remit of the police, such as financial and tax offences, or are reported directly to and processed by the public prosecution office, such as offences relating to false testimony in court.<br><br>The Police Crime Statistics publications are compiled annually based on the data available from the Land Criminal Police Offices and the Federal Criminal Police Office. To calculate the number of criminal offences per 100,000&nbsp;inhabitants, (extrapolated) population figures based on the 2011&nbsp;census are used for the entire time series. This methodology allows comparisons over time to be made from 1993&nbsp;onwards. It should be noted that this results in discrepancies in relation to the Police Crime Statistics data published prior to 2013.<br><br>Changes in the Police Crime Statistics do not always reflect actual changes, as the statistics cover only that proportion of criminal activity that officially comes to the attention of the police. Since there is no statistical data on offences which go unreported, such crimes cannot be reflected in the Police Crime Statistics. However, the proportion of reported versus unreported crime was investigated in 2012&nbsp;and 2017&nbsp;by means of the German Victim Survey. For the offences dealt with in the survey, no statistically significant change in reporting rates was found between 2012&nbsp;and 2017.<br><br>The number of offences was 6,548&nbsp;per 100,000&nbsp;inhabitants in 2019. If the trend seen in recent years continues, the target value of fewer than 6,500&nbsp;offences set for 2030&nbsp;will be achieved. The indicator fell by 21.6% between 1993&nbsp;and 2019. This trajectory, however, has not been continuous. For instance, it increased from 2000&nbsp;to 2004, before entering a slight decline which continued until 2010. The large number of people who entered Germany as refugees and asylum-seekers from 2015&nbsp;on is also reflected in the Police Crime Statistics, with violation of the legislation concerning foreigners (<abbr title=\"for example (exempli gratia)\">e.g.</abbr> illegal entry) soaring by 211.8% in 2016&nbsp;compared with 2014. Such offences had fallen drastically by 2019, though, when they made up only 3% of all criminal offences. Even when violations of the legislation concerning foreigners are accounted for, the total number of criminal offences registered by the police was lower in 2019&nbsp;than in previous years.<br><br>In 2019, the total number of criminal offences registered by the police was 5.4&nbsp;million. Of these, 1.6% involved domestic burglary, 15.3% involved fraud and 2.4% involved dangerous and serious bodily injury. Between 2014&nbsp;and 2019, the incidence of domestic burglary fell by 42.7% and fraud fell by 14%, while cases of dangerous and serious bodily injury rose by 5.8%. The success rate for solving cases was 57.5% of all offences registered by the police in 2019, roughly the same as in the previous year. There were significant differences, however, depending on the type of criminal offence. For domestic burglary, for example, the rate of cases solved was only 17.4%. By contrast, 66.6% of fraud offences and 82.9% of cases of serious and grievous bodily harm cases were cleared up. The comparatively low success rate for domestic burglary is related to a high rate of reporting combined with the comparatively infrequent existence of solid leads pointing to the perpetrators. This is in sharp contrast to cases of fraud and bodily injury. These crimes have high clear-up rates because, in most cases, the identity of the suspect becomes known to the police as the crime is reported.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bka.de/EN/Home/home_node.html\">Federal Criminal Police Office</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.bka.de/EN/Home/home_node.html\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Criminal Police Office</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bka.de/EN/Home/home_node.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/bka.png\" alt=\"Federal Criminal Police Office\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Criminal Police Office\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","source_url_1":"https://www.bka.de/EN/CurrentInformation/PoliceCrimeStatistics/policecrimestatistics_node.html","source_url_text_1":"Police Crime Statistics","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_2_short":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_logo_2":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/destatis.png\" alt=\"Federal Statistical Office\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Statistical Office\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","weather_active_1":true,"weather_indicator_1":"16.1 Criminal offences","weather_indicator_1_year_a":2021,"weather_indicator_1_year_b":2020,"weather_indicator_1_year_c":2019,"weather_indicator_1_year_d":2018,"weather_indicator_1_year_e":2017,"weather_indicator_1_year_f":2016,"weather_indicator_1_year_g":2015,"weather_indicator_1_target":"Reduce the number of criminal offences re-corded per 100,000&nbsp;inhabitants to less than 6,500&nbsp;by 2030","weather_indicator_1_target_1":"Reduce the number of criminal offences re-corded per 100,000&nbsp;inhabitants to less than <b>6,500&nbsp;</b>by <b>2030</b>","weather_indicator_1_target_1_category":"new","weather_indicator_1_target_1_targetYear":2030,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_validFrom":2021,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_title":"If the trend from 2021 had continued, the target value would have been reached or missed by less than 5% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b_title":"If the trend from 2020 had continued, the target value would have been reached or missed by less than 5% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c_title":"If the trend from 2019 had continued, the target value would have been reached or missed by less than 5% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_d":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_d_title":"If the trend from 2018 had continued, the target value would have been reached or missed by less than 5% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_d_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_e":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_e_title":"If the trend from 2017 had continued, the target value would have been reached or missed by less than 5% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_e_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_f":"Blitz","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_f_title":"In 2016 the distance to the target was constantly high or had increased.
