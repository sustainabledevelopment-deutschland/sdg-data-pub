It has issued a framework of standards to which more than 200&nbsp;countries worldwide have committed. The <abbr title=\"Financial Action Task Force\" tabindex=\"0\">FATF</abbr> standards comprise 40&nbsp;Recommendations, which form a key part of international efforts to ensure the integrity and security of the global financial system and serve as the basis for national legislation in many member states. The <abbr title=\"Financial Action Task Force\" tabindex=\"0\">FATF</abbr> conducts regular evaluations in member countries, during which both the technical implementation of the recommendations (Technical Compliance) and their practical effectiveness (Effectiveness) are assessed and reviewed.<br><br>The most recent evaluation of Germany as part of the <abbr title=\"Financial Action Task Force\" tabindex=\"0\">FATF</abbr> assessment process took place from autumn 2020&nbsp;to June 2022. The assessment procedure included an on-site visit by <abbr title=\"Financial Action Task Force\" tabindex=\"0\">FATF</abbr> evaluators. During this visit, interviews were conducted with stakeholders from both the public sector (such as the Federal Ministry of Finance (<abbr title=\"Federal Ministry of Finance\" tabindex=\"0\">BMF</abbr>), the judiciary, law enforcement authorities, the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin), and state supervisory authorities) and the private sector (including banks and financial service providers, as well as professions such as notaries, tax advisors, lawyers, and auditors). The evaluation process highlights both the complexity and the importance of cooperation in combating financial crime under the <abbr title=\"Financial Action Task Force\" tabindex=\"0\">FATF</abbr> review. The overall coordination of the Germany assessment was the responsibility of the <abbr title=\"Federal Ministry of Finance\" tabindex=\"0\">BMF</abbr> within the federal government.<br><br>The assessment of effectiveness is based on eleven intermediate objectives, known as Immediate Outcomes (IOs), which cover various aspects of combating financial crime. These are:<br><br><u>Cross-cutting</u><br><br><ul> <li><abbr title=\"Immediate Outcomes\" tabindex=\"0\">IO</abbr> 1: Risk understanding and coordination</li> <li><abbr title=\"Immediate Outcomes\" tabindex=\"0\">IO</abbr> 2: International cooperation</li> </ul> <u>Preventing misuse (Prevention)</u> <ul> <li><abbr title=\"Immediate Outcomes\" tabindex=\"0\">IO</abbr> 3: Supervision</li> <li><abbr title=\"Immediate Outcomes\" tabindex=\"0\">IO</abbr> 4: Preventive measures by obliged entities</li> <li><abbr title=\"Immediate Outcomes\" tabindex=\"0\">IO</abbr> 5: Beneficial ownership</li> </ul> <u>Combating and prosecuting (Repression)</u> <ul> <li><abbr title=\"Immediate Outcomes\" tabindex=\"0\">IO</abbr> 6: Financial intelligence and investigations</li> <li><abbr title=\"Immediate Outcomes\" tabindex=\"0\">IO</abbr> 7: Money laundering investigations and prosecution</li> <li><abbr title=\"Immediate Outcomes\" tabindex=\"0\">IO</abbr> 8: Confiscation of assets in money laundering cases</li> <li><abbr title=\"Immediate Outcomes\" tabindex=\"0\">IO</abbr> 9: Terrorist financing investigations and prosecution</li> <li><abbr title=\"Immediate Outcomes\" tabindex=\"0\">IO</abbr> 10: Financial sanctions; non-profit organisations (NPOs)</li> <li><abbr title=\"Immediate Outcomes\" tabindex=\"0\">IO</abbr> 11: Proliferation financing</li> </ul> <br><br>Each intermediate objective is rated on a scale ranging from \"low\" to \"moderate\", \"substantial\", and \"high\". For the purposes of this indicator, the total number of intermediate objectives rated as \u201csubstantial\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d is recorded. Changes, whether positive or negative, between the categories \u201clow\u201d and \u201cmoderate\u201d or between \u201csubstantial\u201d and \u201chigh\u201d for individual outcomes are therefore not reflected in this indicator in the following reporting year.<br><br>In the 2022&nbsp;evaluation of Germany, four of the eleven intermediate outcomes (<abbr title=\"Immediate Outcomes\" tabindex=\"0\">IO</abbr> 1, <abbr title=\"Immediate Outcomes\" tabindex=\"0\">IO</abbr> 2, <abbr title=\"Immediate Outcomes\" tabindex=\"0\">IO</abbr> 8, and <abbr title=\"Immediate Outcomes\" tabindex=\"0\">IO</abbr> 9) were assessed as substantial and thus considered passed. The remaining seven intermediate outcomes (<abbr title=\"Immediate Outcomes\" tabindex=\"0\">IO</abbr> 3, <abbr title=\"Immediate Outcomes\" tabindex=\"0\">IO</abbr> 4, <abbr title=\"Immediate Outcomes\" tabindex=\"0\">IO</abbr> 5, <abbr title=\"Immediate Outcomes\" tabindex=\"0\">IO</abbr> 6, <abbr title=\"Immediate Outcomes\" tabindex=\"0\">IO</abbr> 7, <abbr title=\"Immediate Outcomes\" tabindex=\"0\">IO</abbr> 10, and <abbr title=\"Immediate Outcomes\" tabindex=\"0\">IO</abbr> 11) were rated moderate and are therefore considered not passed. The politically defined goal for the next Germany assessment in 2029&nbsp;is to achieve a positive rating in at least eight of the eleven intermediate outcomes.<br><br>In terms of <abbr title=\"Financial Action Task Force\" tabindex=\"0\">FATF</abbr>\u2019s technical requirements (Technical Compliance), Germany was assessed as having \"largely implemented\" the international standards. None of the 40&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Financial Action Task Force\" tabindex=\"0\">FATF</abbr> Recommendations were assessed as \u201cnot implemented\u201d during the 2022&nbsp;review. Only five recommendations were considered \u201cpartially implemented\u201d. In response to this assessment, improvements were made, and in the 2023&nbsp;follow-up report, two of these five were upgraded to \u201clargely implemented\u201d. The threeremaining partially implemented recommendations concern the areas of \u201cCorrespondent banking\u201d, \u201cTransparency and beneficial ownership of legal persons\u201d, and \u201cStatistics\u201d. As of 2023, 37&nbsp;of the <abbr title=\"Financial Action Task Force\" tabindex=\"0\">FATF</abbr> Recommendations were classified as either \u201clargely implemented\u201d (20) or \u201cimplemented\u201d (17).</p>","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/home.html\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the Financial Action Task Force', 'En')\">Financial Action Task Force</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/home.html\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the Financial Action Task Force', 'En')\">Financial Action Task Force</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/home.html\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the Financial Action Task Force', 'En')\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/fatf.png\" alt=\"Financial Action Task Force\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFinancial Action Task Force\" style=\"height:60px;
