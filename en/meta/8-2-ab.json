The public financial balance is calculated as government revenue minus government expenditure, measured on a national accounts basis. The annual structural balance refers to the part of the financial balance that is not attributable to cyclical fluctuations and temporary effects.","dns_indicator_intention":"Sound public finances are an essential element of a sustainable fiscal policy. A policy that relies too heavily on borrowing to fund current public expenditure and then passes this debt on to future generations is simply not sustainable.<br>According to the convergence criteria for the European Union, known as the Maastricht criteria, the annual government deficit should be less than 3% of <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\">GDP</abbr>. The structural deficit must not exceed 0.5% of <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\">GDP</abbr>. These are the stipulations of the European Stability and Growth Pact. The guiding principle of the structurally balanced budget has also been enshrined in Germany\u2019s Basic Law since 2009&nbsp;(Article 109, referred to as the debt brake).","data_state":"The data published in the indicator report 2022 is as of Oct 31 2022.

The structural financial balance, on the other hand, is determined by the Federal Ministry of Finance. The calculation of government net borrowing takes into account the finances of the public authorities, that is to say the Federal Government, the L\u00e4nder and local government, and the finances of the social insurance system.<br><br>In contrast to the previous indicator report, the national accounts calculations were reviewed and revised in 2019&nbsp;as part of their periodic major revision, and the reference year was changed to 2015. As a result, nominal <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\">GDP</abbr> figures are slightly lower on average than they were before the major revision of 2019. The overall economic picture, however, has remained largely unchanged.<br><br>In 2012, the Government achieved an overall surplus of <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 0.3&nbsp;billion, which was the first positive balance since the financial and economic crisis of 2008/2009. In 2019, the financial surplus amounted to <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 52.5&nbsp;billion and 1.5% of <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\">GDP</abbr> (preliminary data). The federal surplus came to <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 22.7&nbsp;billion. At the same time, L\u00e4nder yet again recorded an aggregate surplus (<abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 16.4&nbsp;billion). The balances for local government (<abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 5.1&nbsp;billion) and the social insurance fund (<abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 8.7&nbsp;billion) were also positive. The national budget in 2019&nbsp;showed a structural surplus of 0.6% of <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\">GDP</abbr> (preliminary data). This meant that the <abbr title=\"European Union\">EU</abbr> convergence criteria for both the government deficit and the structural deficit had been met ever since 2012.<br><br>Given the economic repercussions of the <abbr title=\"Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2\">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;pandemic and the government support measures, however, bodies such as the German Council of Economic Experts are already forecasting a negative financial balance in the forthcoming accounts for the 2020&nbsp;and 2021&nbsp;reporting years. This development has not yet been factored into the current status calculation and so has had no bearing on the displayed weather symbol. A valid assessment will not be possible until the figures for 2020&nbsp;have been presented.<br><br>Over the entire period from 1991&nbsp;to 2019&nbsp;the growth of government revenue (134.7%) exceeded that of <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\">GDP</abbr> (117.5%) at current prices as well as expenditure growth (111.4%). Government revenue as a proportion of <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\">GDP</abbr> therefore increased from 43.3% to 46.7%.<br><br>The largest item on the expenditure side of the national accounts is monetary social benefits. These rose by 131.5% from 1991&nbsp;to 2019, thus exceeding the <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\">GDP</abbr> growth rate of 117.5%. Around 70% of monetary social benefits fall under the heading of social insurance, primarily in the form of pensions and unemployment benefits. As a proportion of <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\">GDP</abbr>, monetary social benefits fell from 18.5% in 2003&nbsp;to 15.8% in 2019, which is chiefly due to a steep decline in payments from the unemployment insurance fund. These payments fell by about <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 22.6&nbsp;billion between 2003&nbsp;and 2019&nbsp;as a result of the Hartz welfare legislation and an upturn in the job market.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a
