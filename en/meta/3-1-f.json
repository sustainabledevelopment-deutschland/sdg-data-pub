Besides its health implications, excess weight also has onerous economic and social consequences. The target must therefore be to ensure that the proportion of the population with obesity in Germany does not increase any further.","data_state":"The data published in the indicator report 2022 is as of Oct 31 2022. The data shown on this platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/facts_publications/\">indicator report 2022</a>.","indicator_name":"Obesity rates among adults","section":"Health and nutrition","postulate":"Living healthy longer","target_id":"3.1.1","previous":"3-1-e","next":"3-2-a","content_and_progress":"<b>Text from the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/facts_publications/\">Indicator Report 2021&nbsp;</a></b><br><br>The body mass index (<abbr title=\"Body Mass Index\">BMI</abbr>) is a benchmark that is used to identify excess weight and especially obesity. It is calculated by dividing the body weight in kilograms by the square of an individual\u2019s height in metres (<abbr title=\"Kilogram per square meter\">kg/m\u00b2</abbr>). This calculation does not take account of age- and gender-specific differences or of an individual\u2019s body mass composition.<br><br>People with a <abbr title=\"Body Mass Index\">BMI</abbr> of 25&nbsp;and above are regarded as overweight, according to the World Health Organization (<abbr title=\"World Health Organization\">WHO</abbr>) classification, and those with a <abbr title=\"Body Mass Index\">BMI</abbr> of 30&nbsp;as obese.<br><br>The data basis for the indicator is the microcensus conducted by the Federal Statistical Office. That sample survey covers 1% of the total population. The questions on health are asked every four years as a rule, and responses to them are voluntary. The indicator is thus based on the proportion of the population with a <abbr title=\"Body Mass Index\">BMI</abbr> of 30&nbsp;and higher who answered the questions concerning body weight and height in the microcensus.<br><br>The corresponding data were standardised relative to the European population of 1990&nbsp;to allow comparisons of data from different years and regions without distortions resulting from diverse age structures. Since the questions on health in the microcensus are not asked annually, the chart data for the intervening years have been interpolated. Where people provide information about themselves, as in the microcensus, body weight is often understated compared with measured values, whereas height is more likely to be overstated. As a result, the <abbr title=\"Body Mass Index\">BMI</abbr> calculated on the basis of respondents\u2019 own information is lower than a <abbr title=\"Body Mass Index\">BMI</abbr> based on measured data.<br><br>In 2017, 14.8% of the population in Germany over the age of 18&nbsp;were classified as obese. The obesity rate for men in this population, at 16.4%, was higher than that for women (13.0%). In 1999, 10.7% of the population were obese. At that time too, the proportion of women affected by obesity (10.2%) was slightly lower than that of men (11.1%). The obesity rate among adults, in other words, has increased and so is moving away from the goal of the German Sustainable Development Strategy. A further 34.0% of the population aged 18&nbsp;and above had a <abbr title=\"Body Mass Index\">BMI</abbr> of at least 25&nbsp;but below 30&nbsp;in 2017. This means that 48.8% have a <abbr title=\"Body Mass Index\">BMI</abbr> of 25&nbsp;or more and are therefore considered overweight. Again, the proportion of women (39.0%) was lower than that of men (58.0%).<br><br>The proportion of adults suffering from obesity increases with age and does not decrease until an advanced age is reached. In 2017, 3.4% of 18- to 19-year-old women were obese. For the 30-34&nbsp;age group, the figure had already risen to 10.1%. The obesity rate for women peaked in the 65-69&nbsp;age group at 21.7%. In each of the age groups below 75, the obesity rate for men was higher than for women of the same age, the highest rates being recorded in the 60-64&nbsp;age group, at 24.5%, and the 65-69&nbsp;age group, at 25.3%.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/destatis.png\" alt=\"Federal Statistical Office\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Statistical Office\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","weather_active_1":true,"weather_indicator_1":"3.1.f Obesity rate among adults","weather_indicator_1_year_a":2021,"weather_indicator_1_year_b":2017,"weather_indicator_1_target":"Increase to be permanently halted","weather_indicator_1_target_1":"Increase to be permanently halted","weather_indicator_1_target_1_category":"normal","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a":"Blitz","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_title":"In 2021 neither the average value nor the last change pointed in the right direction.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b":"Blitz","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b_title":"In 2017 neither the average value nor the last change pointed in the right direction.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b_valid":true,"data_show_map":true,"copyright":"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2022","data_footnote":"Age-standardized data (new European standard population).","graph_title":"Share of adults suffering from obesity","precision":[{"decimals":1.0}],"span_gaps":true,"show_line":true,"graph_type":"line","data_start_values":[{"field":"Time series","value":"Obesity rate among adults"},{"field":"Sex","value":"Female"},{"field":"Sex","value":"Male"}],"graph_stepsize":[{"step":2.0}],"national_geographical_coverage":"Germany","page_content":"\n\n<div>\n  <div class=\"my-header\">\n    <label class=\"default\">Obesity: increase to be permanently halted\n      <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/status\"><img src=\"https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/public/Wettersymbole/Blitz.png\" title=\"In 2021 neither the average value nor the last change pointed in the right direction.\" alt=\"Weathersymbol: Thuder strom\"/>\n      </a>\n    </label>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"my-header-note\">\n  <label class=\"default\"><b>(Evaluation of the indicator report 2022 relating to the reporting year 2021)\n  </b></label>\n</div>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-30","national_data_updated_date":"2022-11-28","indicator_number":"3.1.f","target_number":"3.1","goal_number":"3","language":"en"}
