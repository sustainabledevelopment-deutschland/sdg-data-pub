The Alpine landscape is not currently taken into account, because of uncertainty of data.<br><br>The population size of each species is calculated annually from the results of bird-monitoring programmes by the Federation of German Avifaunists in cooperation with the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation and is expressed in relation to the target population size. The target value for each species is defined by a panel of experts&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;initially for 2015. The historical values for 1970&nbsp;and 1975&nbsp;are reconstructed.<br><br>Each sub-indicator represents the arithmetic mean of the degrees of success achieved across the 10&nbsp;or 11&nbsp;selected avian species. The overall indicator is derived from a weighted summation of the sub-indicators. The weighting relates to the proportion of German territory which each main habitat or landscape type covers. On a provisional basis, the target values for the sub-indicators and the overall indicator have been applied unchanged to the 2030&nbsp;target year.<br><br>In 1990, the indicator for biodiversity and landscape quality was significantly lower than the reconstructed values for 1970&nbsp;and 1975. The indicator value stagnated over the last ten reporting years (2006-2016), reaching 70.5&nbsp;% of the target value in 2016&nbsp;compared with 70.2&nbsp;% in 2006. If this trend continues, the goal for 2030&nbsp;will not be achieved.<br><br>During the same period, however, the sub-indicators for the various types of habitat did not follow uniform trajectories. The farmland and coasts and seas sub-indicators fell during the last ten reporting years, to 60.5&nbsp;% and 58.0&nbsp;% of their target values in 2016&nbsp;respectively. The equivalent values in 2006&nbsp;were 68.0&nbsp;% for farmland and 63.2&nbsp;% for coasts and seas.<br><br>In contrast, the forest, settlement and inland-waters sub-indicators moved in a positive direction over the last ten reporting years. The forest sub-indicator reached 87.5&nbsp;% of its target value in 2016, compared with 78.6&nbsp;% in 2006. The settlement sub-indicator rose from 65.1&nbsp;% in 2006&nbsp;to 75.5&nbsp;% in 2016. The figure for inland waters was 75.0&nbsp;% of the target value in 2016, compared with 63.1&nbsp;% in 2006.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bfn.de/en.html\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation', 'En')\">Federal Institute for Research on Building, Urban Affairs and Spatial Development</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.bfn.de/en.html\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation', 'En')\">Federal Institute for Research on Building, Urban Affairs and Spatial Development</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bfn.de/en.html\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation', 'En')\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/bfn.png\" alt=\"Federal Institute for Research on Building, Urban Affairs and Spatial Development\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Institute for Research on Building, Urban Affairs and Spatial Development\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border:transparent\"/></a>","source_url_1":"https://www.bfn.de/indikator-artenvielfalt-und-landschaftsqualitaet","source_url_text_1":"\u201eBiodiversity and landscape quality\u201c indicator (only available in German)","source_url_alert_1":"the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation","weather_active_1":true,"weather_indicator_1":"15.1 Biodiversity and landscape quality","weather_indicator_1_year_a":2016,"weather_indicator_1_year_b":2015,"weather_indicator_1_year_c":2014,"weather_indicator_1_year_d":2013,"weather_indicator_1_year_e":2012,"weather_indicator_1_year_f":2011,"weather_indicator_1_year_g":2010,"weather_indicator_1_target":"Reach the index value of 100&nbsp;by 2030","weather_indicator_1_target_1":"Reach the index value of 100&nbsp;by 2030","weather_indicator_1_target_1_category":"normal","weather_indicator_1_target_1_targetYear":2030,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_title":"Although the indicator has in 2016 been moving in the desired direction toward the target, if the trend had to continued, the target would have been missed in the target year by more than 20% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b_title":"Although the indicator has in 2015 been moving in the desired direction toward the target, if the trend had to continued, the target would have been missed in the target year by more than 20% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c":"Blitz","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c_title":"In 2014 the distance to the target was constantly high or had increased.
