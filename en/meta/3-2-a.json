On this basis, the Federal Environment Agency calculated a non-weighted, arithmetic mean of the individual reductions in the specified air pollutants as a target. The rates of change in the individual air pollutants are offset equally against one another. Notwithstanding the separate reduction targets, this means that increasing emissions of individual pollutants covered by this indicator may be offset by higher reductions in the emissions of other pollutants.<br><br>The data are computed annually by the Federal Environment Agency from various sources. They serve as a basis for the reporting obligation under the Geneva Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (<abbr title=\"Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution\">CLRTAP</abbr>) and the National Emission Ceilings (<abbr title=\"National Emission Ceilings Directive\">NEC</abbr>) Directive. The data undergo further analysis as part of the environmental economic accounting performed by the Federal Statistical Office. The emissions, for instance, are broken down by origin into various branches of economic activity and private households.<br><br>Overall emissions of air pollutants fell by 24.7% from 2005&nbsp;to 2018. The indicator has thus moved in the desired direction, and the target for 2030&nbsp;will be achieved if the trend is maintained. Emissions of individual pollutants changed to varying degrees, however, in the period from 2005&nbsp;to 2018.<br><br>Emissions of non-methane volatile organic compounds (<abbr title=\"non-methane volatile organic compounds\">NMVOC</abbr>)s, which are primarily due to the industrial use of solvents, were reduced by a significant 24.6% during that period. This means that the targeted reduction of 28% by 2030&nbsp;is achievable.<br><br>Emissions of particulate matter (<abbr title=\"Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 2.5&nbsp;micrometers)\">PM\u2082.\u2085</abbr>) fell by 31.5% in the aforesaid period. If the annual average trend were maintained, the set reduction target would be achieved for these emissions too. The largest source of particulate emissions in 2018&nbsp;was industry, which accounted for 29.3% of the total. Households and small-scale consumers discharged 24.1%, chiefly from heating systems. Transport accounted for 25.5% of particulate emissions, which was 10.6&nbsp;percentage points down on 2005.<br><br>Emissions of nitrogen oxides (<abbr title=\"Nitrogen oxides\">NO\u2093</abbr>) fell by 27.0% from 2005&nbsp;to 2018&nbsp;and so are heading in the desired direction. The average reduction of the past few years, however, would not suffice to meet the target. The majority of nitrogen oxides emitted in 2018&nbsp;came from transport and the energy industry.<br><br>Emissions of sulphur dioxide (<abbr title=\"Sulphur dioxide\">SO\u2082</abbr>), which are mainly discharged by the energy industry, fell by 39.5% in the reference period. This trend has moved in the right direction. The average reduction of the past few years would be sufficient to meet the target.<br><br>Emissions of ammonia (<abbr title=\"Ammonia\">NH\u2083</abbr>) declined by 0.8% from 2005&nbsp;to 2018&nbsp;and remain persistently high. This stagnation is mainly due to the spreading of fermentation residues from fuel crops. According to calculations by the Federal Environment Agency, 95.3% of all national ammonia emissions in 2018&nbsp;originated from agricultural production, particularly livestock farming.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en\">German Environment Agency</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en\" target=\"_blank\">German Environment Agency</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"www.dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/uba.png\" alt=\"German Environment Agency\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationGerman Environment Agency\" style=\"height:60px;
