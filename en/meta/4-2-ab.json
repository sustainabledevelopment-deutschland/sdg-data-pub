All-day childcare is provided for a contractually agreed, continuous care period of more than seven hours per day; day care in private homes and care of pupils are not included. Indicator 4.2.a refers to the group of 0&nbsp;to 2-year-old children, indicator 4.2.b to the group of 3&nbsp;to 5-year-old children.","dns_indicator_intention":"The proportion of 0&nbsp;to 2-year-old children attending all-day care is to reach at least 35&nbsp;% (4.2.a) by 2030. For 3&nbsp;to 5-year-olds (4.2.b), the proportion is to increase to at least 70&nbsp;% by 2030. An increase in the proportion of children attending all-day care is desirable because the availability of childcare options that meet the needs of today\u2019s families improve the compatibility of family life and work. They also make an important contribution to equal opportunities, gender equality and integration.","data_state":"The data published in the indicator report 2022 is as of 31 October 2022. The data shown on this platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/assets/Publikationen/Indikatorenberichte/2022.pdf\">indicator report 2022</a>.","indicator_name":"All-day care provision for children","section":"Prospects for families","postulate":"Improving the compatibility of work and family life","target_id":"4.2.1","previous":"4-1-b","next":"5-1-a","content_and_progress":"<b>Text from the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/assets/Publikationen/Indikatorenberichte/2022.pdf\">Indicator Report 2022&nbsp;</a></b><br><br>The indicators show the proportion of children for whom daily childcare of more than seven hours has been arranged, which may deviate from the actual time spent in childcare. Contractually agreed childcare provision of seven hours and less, which can also improve the compatibility of work and family life, and other types of care, <abbr title=\"for example (exempli gratia)\" tabindex=\"0\">e.g.</abbr> day care in private homes, are not included. Furthermore, information on childcare services aimed at children aged 6&nbsp;years and older is also relevant to this topic. Such supplementary information is included, for example, in the data of the Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the L\u00e4nder in the Federal Republic of Germany (see the last paragraph).<br><br>The information of the indicator is provided by the annual statistics on children cared for and persons employed in day care centres, which is compiled by the Federal Statistical Office. In 2022, all-day care in day care centres was arranged for 47.0&nbsp;% of the 3&nbsp;to 5-year-old children (kindergarten age). For children under 3&nbsp;years of age (nursery age) this figure was 16.8&nbsp;%. As a result, the share of children in all-day care below the age of 3&nbsp;almost tripled and have more than doubled for the 3&nbsp;to 5-year-olds since 2006. However, the increase for both indicators is significantly reducing since 2014&nbsp;and, furthermore, the share of children for both age groups in all-day care is diminishing since 2020.<br><br>The total number of children below the age of six receiving all-day care in day care centres in 2022&nbsp;was 1.61&nbsp;million. Another 67,416&nbsp;children below six years of age were receiving publicly subsidised childminder care; like those five-year-old children who are already at school, they are not covered by the indicator. In addition, in 2022&nbsp;some 1.46&nbsp;million children were receiving part-time care of seven hours or less.<br><br>Both age groups reported stagnating or declining total number of children in population until 2014, but the increased migration of refugees significantly increased the number of children since 2015. However, the growing number of refugees had no effect on the number of children in all-day care from 2015&nbsp;until the pandemic and, hence, the growth of the indicators was weakened.<br><br>In 2020, more than a quarter of the children under six years cared for in day care centres or by publicly supported childminding services had a migrant background, meaning that at least one of the parents was of foreign origin. 51&nbsp;% of these children were in day care, compared with 71&nbsp;% of the children without a migrant background.<br><br>With regard to the availability of all-day care provided by facilities, there is a clear gap between the L\u00e4nder in the east and the L\u00e4nder in the west of Germany. The highest percentages of 0&nbsp;to 2-year-olds in all-day care are recorded in the eastern L\u00e4nder and in Berlin. The values range from 50.7&nbsp;% in Thuringia to 9.5&nbsp;% in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. For 3&nbsp;to 5-year-olds, the percentage was also highest in Thuringia at 91.6&nbsp;% and lowest in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg at 24.1&nbsp;% (each 2022).<br><br>When it comes to opportunities of care for pupils, pre and after-school care programmes and all-day schools also play a significant role. In 2021, 18,967&nbsp;children between 5&nbsp;and 13&nbsp;years of age were looked after on an all-day basis in care programmes and 486,408&nbsp;children part-time (lessons are not regarded as childcare). The percentage of pupils attending all-day schools of all pupils in schools of general education was 47.2&nbsp;% in the 2020/2021&nbsp;school year. However, this figure includes pupils from all school types and hence includes also pupils who are older than 13&nbsp;years. In primary schools, 46.5&nbsp;% of children received all-day care in that school year. In comparison to 2006, the number of all-day school pupils has increased considerably in 2021, from almost 1.5&nbsp;million to 3.4&nbsp;million (in all schools of general education) and from 0.4&nbsp;million to 1.3&nbsp;million in the primary schools.","embedded_feature_html":"<p>Additional data series for the indicator can be found <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/AddInfos/en/4_2_ab.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" >here</a>.</p><br><small>Note: You can display the PDF document directly in your browser or download the PDF document and open it with a PDF reader of your choice.
