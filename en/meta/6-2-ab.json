Measures taken by other parties, such as the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (<abbr title=\"German Agency for International Cooperation\" tabindex=\"0\">GIZ</abbr>), L\u00e4nder and private aid agencies, are not taken into account. The indicator is based exclusively on the planned scope of new funding commitments for drinking water and sanitation projects at the time of submission of the programme proposal to the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development. The <abbr title=\"Reconstruction Loan Corporation\" tabindex=\"0\">KfW</abbr> assesses the number of people who, following completion of the construction projects, will have obtained first-time or improved access to drinking water and sanitation or will be able to benefit from the constructed facilities. Whether people are actually reached cannot be estimated in practice until the infrastructure has become operational, and this is not what the indicator shows. Since a person may obtain first-time or improved access to both drinking water and sanitation, double counting is possible between the two indicators and between two years. The funding granted by the <abbr title=\"Reconstruction Loan Corporation\" tabindex=\"0\">KfW</abbr> comprises grants and loans financed from the federal budget and funds raised in the financial markets. The recipients are generally developing and emerging countries, which means that this indicator is related to indicator 17.1&nbsp;\u201cOfficial development assistance as a proportion of gross national income\u201d.<br><br>In 2019&nbsp;the data collection method was revised. Whereas the indicator previously counted people who were reached either directly, <abbr title=\"for example (exempli gratia)\" tabindex=\"0\">e.g.</abbr> by domestic connections, or indirectly, <abbr title=\"for example (exempli gratia)\" tabindex=\"0\">e.g.</abbr> the entire population of a country supported by a sectoral reform programme, it now covers only those people who are reached directly. In 2017, for instance, of the total of 28.6&nbsp;million recorded beneficiaries, 19.1&nbsp;million were reached directly. In 2018, 15.2&nbsp;million out of a total of 60.3&nbsp;million were direct beneficiaries. Another change lies in the fact that the figure is based only on the proportion of beneficiaries who have been reached by German-funded share of measures. Contributions made by other donors and the efforts of the host country itself are not counted. Similarly, no consideration is given to energy-efficiency measures, improvements to operational processes or renewals of pumping stations, since these do not lead directly to improved access for the target group.<br><br>In recent years, the planned numbers of people who were to obtain access to drinking water and sanitation with German support have always been above the target of ten million. Under the revised methodology, the planned numbers of people who were to obtain first-time or improved access in 2020&nbsp;were about 10.9&nbsp;million for drinking water and 1.8&nbsp;million for wastewater and sanitation. The target of the indicator 6.2.a was achieved for the year 2020, however, the target value for indicator 6.2.b was significantly below the intended level. In the preceding year, more than four million people were reached by German support and have received access to sanitation facilities.<br><br>The commitments made by the <abbr title=\"Reconstruction Loan Corporation\" tabindex=\"0\">KfW</abbr> with regard to drinking water and sanitation rose by 26.0&nbsp;% from 2012&nbsp;to 2018&nbsp;to more than 1&nbsp;billion euros. In 2019&nbsp;and 2020, these decreased to 677.1&nbsp;million euros. By contrast with the commitments, disbursements have steadily declined since 2015&nbsp;to the most recent figure of 432.1&nbsp;million euros. One of the main reasons for this lies in the time lag between commitments and payments.</p>","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.kfw.de/kfw.de-2.html\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the Credit Institute for Reconstruction', 'En')\">Credit Institute for Reconstruction</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.kfw.de/kfw.de-2.html\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the Credit Institute for Reconstruction', 'En')\">Credit Institute for Reconstruction</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.kfw.de/kfw.de-2.html\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the Credit Institute for Reconstruction', 'En')\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/kfw.png\" alt=\"Credit Institute for Reconstruction\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationCredit Institute for Reconstruction\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border:transparent\"/></a>","weather_active_1":true,"weather_indicator_1":"6.2.a Anzahl der Menschen mit einer neuen oder verbesserten Trinkwasserversorgung","weather_indicator_1_year_a":2023,"weather_indicator_1_year_b":2022,"weather_indicator_1_year_c":2021,"weather_indicator_1_year_d":2020,"weather_indicator_1_year_e":2019,"weather_indicator_1_target":"6&nbsp;Millionen Menschen pro Jahr bis 2030","weather_indicator_1_target_1":"<b>6&nbsp;Millionen</b> Menschen pro Jahr bis <b>2030</b>","weather_indicator_1_target_1_category":"normal","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a":"Keine","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_title":"Keine Bewertung m\u00f6glich.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b":null,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b_title":null,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c":null,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c_title":null,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_d":null,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_d_title":null,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_d_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_e":null,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_e_title":null,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_e_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_note":"Durch die methodische \u00c4nderung in 2019&nbsp;ist ein Vergleich der Daten der Erhebungsjahre ab 2019&nbsp;mit den Vorjahren nicht m\u00f6glich (Zeitreihenbruch).
