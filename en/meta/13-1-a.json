The German Government therefore aims to lower greenhouse gas emissions in Germany by at least 40% compared with 1990&nbsp;by 2020&nbsp;and by at least 55% by 2030.

However, this cumulative reporting obscures the development of each greenhouse gas on its own, as a negative trend in one can be balanced out by the positive trend in another.<br><br>The data are provided annually by the Federal Environment Agency as part of the reporting required under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (<abbr title=\"United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\" tabindex=\"0\">UNFCCC</abbr>) and the Kyoto Protocol. The measuring and reporting of emissions is subject to a comprehensive quality-management regime.<br><br>The emissions are calculated in accordance with the territoriality or production principle.<br><br>The largest emitters of greenhouse gases and air pollutants within Germany were therefore identified, and the quantity of their emissions under certain circumstances was investigated. A specific emissions factor derived from those findings was then multiplied by the emitter\u2019s activity data to arrive at the overall quantity of emissions. It should be noted that, in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol, the indicator does not show carbon dioxide emissions arising from land use, land-use change and forestry (<abbr title=\"Land use, land-use change and forestry\" tabindex=\"0\">LULUCF</abbr>). Maritime shipping and international aviation are also excluded from the calculation. Looking at developments between 2015&nbsp;and 2019, it is clear that the indicator has not progressed in a stable manner. In 2015&nbsp;and 2016, greenhouse-gas emissions rose slightly, by 0.3&nbsp;and 0.2&nbsp;percentage points respectively. Since 2017, however, they have sunk noticeably, by 1.2&nbsp;percentage points in 2017&nbsp;and 2.9&nbsp;percentage points in 2018. Over the long term, the projected figures for 2019&nbsp;from the Federal Environment Agency show a total reduction of 35.7% compared with 1990. If the trend seen over the last five reporting years continues, the target for 2020&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;a reduction of 40% compared with 1990&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;is unlikely to be reached.<br><br>By far the greatest share of total greenhouse-gas emissions in 2019&nbsp;was carbon dioxide, at 87.7%, compared with 84.1% in 1990. Most recently, methane accounted for 6.2% of the total, with nitrous oxide on 4.3%, <abbr title=\"Hydrofluorocarbons\" tabindex=\"0\">HFCs</abbr> on 1.3% and sulphur hexafluoride on 0.5% (the latter two being figures for 2017). By far the largest proportion of <abbr title=\"Carbon dioxide\" tabindex=\"0\">CO\u2082</abbr> emissions arise from the generation of electricity and heat. Methane and nitrous oxide are emitted primarily by agricultural production.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en\">German Environment
