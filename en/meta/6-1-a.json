The consequences of this are algae growth, oxygen depletion and even fish mortality or the growth of toxic blue-green algae. For this reason, adherence at all monitoring sites to the benchmark values indicated in the Ordinance on the Protection of Surface Waters (Oberfl\u00e4chengew\u00e4sserverordnung) for the relevant water types was defined as a goal for 2030.","data_state":"The data published in the indicator report 2022 is as of Oct 31 2022. The data shown on this platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/facts_publications/\">indicator report 2022</a>.","indicator_name":"Phosphorus in flowing waters","section":"Water quality","postulate":"Reduction of substance pollution in water","target_id":"6.1.1","previous":"5-1-e","next":"6-1-b","content_and_progress":"<b>Text from the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/facts_publications/\">Indicator Report 2021&nbsp;</a></b><br><br>The pollution of rivers with phosphorus is measured by the L\u00e4nder as part of their monitoring under the <abbr title=\"European Union\" tabindex=\"0\">EU</abbr> Water Framework Directive. The data used for the indicator are taken from the surveillance network, which comprises some 250&nbsp;monitoring sites. In most cases, the monitoring sites were established in the main flows of the large rivers and at the mouths of important tributaries. The data are compiled by the Federal Environment Agency on the basis of information from the German Working Group on Water Issues of the L\u00e4nder and the Federal Government (<abbr title=\"German Working Group on Water Issues of the L\u00e4nder and the Federal Government\" tabindex=\"0\">LAWA</abbr>).<br><br>Each of the figures used to calculate the indicator value shows whether the annual average reading from a particular monitoring site adhered to or fell below the benchmark value but not the extent to which the threshold was exceeded. The information from the individual monitoring sites is presented in aggregated form. Accordingly, the value of the indicator depends on the number of monitoring sites and how representative their distribution is. Lakes and other bodies of water are not covered by the indicator.<br><br>Since the different bodies of water react with differing levels of sensitivity to nutrients such as phosphorous, the precise benchmark values vary. The vast majority of flowing waters use the benchmark value of 0.1&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\" tabindex=\"0\">mg/l</abbr> of phosphorous. In organic substrate-dominated rivers, the benchmark value is 0.15&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\" tabindex=\"0\">mg/l</abbr>, for marshland streams 0.3&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\" tabindex=\"0\">mg/l</abbr> and for transitional waters influenced by tidal movement 0.045&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\" tabindex=\"0\">mg/l</abbr>.<br><br>The indicators of phosphorous and nitrate levels (6.1.a and 6.1.b) cover two key aspects of water quality. However, there are other, additional components such as the existence of natural habitats around water bodies and the exposure to pollutants (such as pesticides, metals, medicines), all of which are also relevant to water quality. Phosphorous generally enters a body of water through the input of phosphates.<br><br>In 2018, the annual average of values measured was below the benchmark value at 44% of the monitoring points at rivers. 50% of the monitoring points showed average concentrations of up to twice the benchmark value, while 4% of the monitoring points were in the range of up to four times the benchmark value (not shown in the chart). The remaining 2% showed even higher concentrations.<br><br>When viewed over time, the proportion of monitoring points not exceeding the benchmark value has continuously increased and has doubled since 1990. However, the percentage rate of monitoring points with concentrations of up to twice the benchmark value tripled during the same period. Conversely, the share of monitoring points with even higher values has fallen significantly since the early 1990s. The level of pollution has been reduced significantly thanks in particular to the introduction of phosphate-free detergents and the specification of threshold values for the discharge of treated waste water.<br><br>Considering the average trend of the last five years, the indicator has developed slightly positively. The goal of not exceeding the specified threshold value at all monitoring points was still clearly missed.<br><br>","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en\">German Environment Agency on the basis of data from the German Working Group on Water Issues of the L\u00e4nder and the Federal Government (LAWA)</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en\" target=\"_blank\">German Environment Agency on the basis of data from the German Working Group on Water Issues of the L\u00e4nder and the Federal Government (LAWA)</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/uba.png\" alt=\"German Environment Agency on the basis of data from the German Working Group on Water Issues of the L\u00e4nder and the Federal Government (LAWA)\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationGerman Environment Agency on the basis of data from the German Working Group on Water Issues of the L\u00e4nder and the Federal Government (LAWA)\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","source_url_1":"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en/data/environmental-indicators/indicator-river-eutrophication-phosphorus","source_url_text_1":"Sampling sites which exceeded the requirement for good status for total phosphorus in rivers","weather_active_1":true,"weather_indicator_1":"6.1.a Phosphorous in flowing waters","weather_indicator_1_year_a":2020,"weather_indicator_1_year_b":2019,"weather_indicator_1_year_c":2018,"weather_indicator_1_year_d":2017,"weather_indicator_1_year_e":2016,"weather_indicator_1_year_f":2015,"weather_indicator_1_year_g":2014,"weather_indicator_1_target":"Not exceeding benchmark values for specific types of water bodies at all monitoring points by 2030","weather_indicator_1_target_1":"Not exceeding benchmark values for specific types of water bodies at all monitoring points by 2030","weather_indicator_1_target_1_category":"normal","weather_indicator_1_target_1_targetYear":2030,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_title":"Although the indicator has in 2020 been moving in the desired direction toward the target, if the trend had to continued, the target would have been missed in the target year by more than 20% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b_title":"Although the indicator has in 2019 been moving in the desired direction toward the target, if the trend had to continued, the target would have been missed in the target year by more than 20% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c_title":"Although the indicator has in 2018 been moving in the desired direction toward the target, if the trend had to continued, the target would have been missed in the target year by more than 20% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_d":"Blitz","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_d_title":"In 2017 the distance to the target was constantly high or had increased.
