Nitrogen removal results from plant and animal market products. Nitrogen surplus in its gaseous state can leak to the atmosphere or accumulate in soil or groundwater, enabling nitrogen input to rivers or other ecosystems. Hence, the nitrogen surplus from farming has a direct impact on the development of the indicators 6.1.b \u201cNitrate in groundwater\u201c, 14.1.a \u201cNitrogen inputs via the inflows into the North and Baltic Seas\u201c and 15.2&nbsp;\u201cEutrophication of ecosystems\u201c. Nitrogen input from farming into the atmosphere has an impact on indicator 3.2.a \u201cEmissions of air pollutants\u201c through formation of nitrogen dioxide and ammonia.<br><br>The indicator is calculated by the Institute for Crop and Soil Science at the Julius K\u00fchn Institute and the Institute of Landscape Ecology and Resources Management at the University of Gie\u00dfen. In 2020, fertilisers were the most important component of nitrogen input in the overall balance, accounting for 51.1&nbsp;% (86&nbsp;kilograms of nitrogen per hectare). Feedstuff contributed 36.9&nbsp;% (62&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Kilogram per hectare\" tabindex=\"0\">kg/ha</abbr>), the biological nitrogen fixation 8.2&nbsp;% (14&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Kilogram per hectare\" tabindex=\"0\">kg/ha</abbr>) and the non-agricultural emissions 1.9&nbsp;% (3&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Kilogram per hectare\" tabindex=\"0\">kg/ha</abbr>) to nitrogen input.<br><br>The relevant time series for the indicator is based on the moving five-year average of the total balances of the relevant year as well as the two preceding and subsequent years. Thereby, yearly meteorological and market fluctuations, which cannot be influenced by farms, are balanced. The indicator does not provide an interpretation regarding the regional distribution of nitrogen surpluses.<br><br>During the period from 1992&nbsp;to 2018, the moving five-year average of nitrogen balance decreased by 25.4&nbsp;% (from 116.6&nbsp;to 87.0&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Kilogram\" tabindex=\"0\">kg</abbr> per hectare and year). The decline of nitrogen surplus until 2010&nbsp;resulted from diminished use of fertilisers and diminishing numbers of livestock in the new L\u00e4nder.<br><br>Until 2015, nitrogen surplus stagnated. The marginal decline of the indicator in the remaining course of the time series is based on a minor reduction in mineral fertiliser use and improved harvest yields resulting from technical advances in plant production and breeding (more efficient nitrogen fertilisation, variety spectrum) combined with the simultaneous expansion in the cultivation of high-yield crop types (maize, wheat) as well as improved feed conversion by livestock.<br><br>Since 2015, the nitrogen surplus decreased and the recent reduction was 4.9&nbsp;% in 2018. It is uncertain, to what extent extreme agroclimatic conditions (drought from 2018&nbsp;until 2020) and the amended fertiliser regulation released in 2017&nbsp;contributed to this positive trend. A reduction to 70&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Kilogram per hectare\" tabindex=\"0\">kg/ha</abbr> is only possible, if this trend continues in the next years.","embedded_feature_html":"<p>Additional data series for the indicator can be found <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/AddInfos/en/2_1_a.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" >here</a>.</p><br><small>Note: You can display the PDF document directly in your browser or download the PDF document and open it with a PDF reader of your choice.
