Formal education includes educational activities in schools, colleges and universities that follow a defined curriculum, lead to a qualification recognised in the national qualification framework such as the Abitur, Bachelor's or Master's degree, and last at least six months. Non-formal education refers to organised learning activities outside the formal education system, such as vocational training, workshops or online courses, which impart specific skills or knowledge but do not lead to a formal qualification.<br><br>The data for the indicator is sourced from the Adult Education Survey (AES), a Europe-wide coordinated survey that captures the continuing education behaviour of the adult population. It records the extent to which adults participate in formal or non-formal learning activities, the types of education or training they pursue, and their reasons for participating or not participating in further education. The survey is mandatory for all EU member states and is conducted every six years. In the intervening years, national surveys are conducted in Germany, which from 2025&nbsp;onwards will take place every three years (previously every two years).<br><br>Since the first survey in 2007, the share of 25- to 64-year-olds participating in further education has steadily increased from 45% to 62% in 2020. Since 2016, the participation rates of men and women in this age group have been nearly identical. The most recent survey in 2022&nbsp;recorded a slight decline to 60%, which may be linked to the COVID-19&nbsp;pandemic and associated restrictions, such as the absence of in-person courses. A similar decline was also observed in other surveys related to continuing education. Compared to the EU average of 46.6%, Germany remains well above the European benchmark.<br><br>Non-formal education or training accounted for the vast majority of the indicator value. In 2022, 57.8% of respondents reported participating in such activities, while only 7.4% were engaged in formal education. The total exceeds the overall indicator value because 5.2% of respondents participated in both formal education and non-formal learning activities.<br><br>Among the non-formal education and training courses undertaken, the subject area <i>Business, Administration and Law</i> was the most represented at 25.4%, followed by <i>Services</i> (18.9%), <i>Health and Welfare</i> (14.3%), and <i>Information and Communication Technologies</i> (14.0%).<br><br>An analysis of the results by age group reveals that participation in further education significantly declines with age. While 70.5% of those aged 25&nbsp;to 34&nbsp;participated in education or training, the figures dropped to 61.8% for those aged 35&nbsp;to 44, 60.1% for those aged 45&nbsp;to 54, and 51.5% for those aged 55&nbsp;to 64.<br><br>The indicator makes no distinction regarding the nature of the education or training undertaken. For example, Master's degree programmes are counted in the same way as one-off short workshops attended purely out of personal interest. As a result, the indicator provides a good overall picture of the quantitative scope of participation in education and training but does not allow conclusions to be drawn about the duration or quality of the activities undertaken.<br><br>Despite the recent decline, the average trend over the past years has been positive, suggesting that the politically set target of 65% participation in education and training may be achievable by 2027, provided the recent average trend continues.</p>","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/destatis.png\" alt=\"Federal Statistical Office\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Statistical Office\" style=\"height:60px;
