It is calculated by dividing the body weight in kilograms by the square of an individual\u2019s height in metres (<abbr title=\"Kilogram per square meter\">kg/m\u00b2</abbr>). This calculation does not take account of age- and gender-specific differences or of an individual\u2019s body mass composition. Since the ratio of height to weight constantly changes in children and adolescents, there is no single threshold value for all age groups for the classification of excess weight and obesity. Excess weight and obesity among children and adolescents are defined by using an individual\u2019s age and gender to compare his or her <abbr title=\"Body Mass Index\">BMI</abbr> with those of a predefined reference population. The percentile reference values proposed by Katrin Kromeyer-Hauschild are used as a comparison, as recommended by the Childhood Obesity Federation (<abbr title=\"Childhood Obesity Federation\">AGA</abbr>). In this method, children and adolescents are said to be overweight if their <abbr title=\"Body Mass Index\">BMI</abbr> is above the 90th age and gender-specific percentile of the reference population (> <abbr title=\"90th percentile\">P90</abbr>), that is to say if they fall within the range of those 10% of the reference group with the highest <abbr title=\"Body Mass Index\">BMIs</abbr>. A <abbr title=\"Body Mass Index\">BMI</abbr> above the 97th percentile of the reference population (<abbr title=\"that is to say (id est)\">i.e.</abbr> as high as the 3% of children and adolescents with the highest <abbr title=\"Body Mass Index\">BMIs</abbr>) is classified as obesity (> <abbr title=\"97th percentile\">P97</abbr>). For example, girls and boys aged three with a <abbr title=\"Body Mass Index\">BMI</abbr> of 18.8&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Kilogram per square meter\">kg/m\u00b2</abbr> are considered to be obese. These reference values are based on details of body size and weight that were recorded between 1985&nbsp;and 1998&nbsp;in various regions of Germany, using different methods.<br><br>The data for the indicator was collected by the Robert Koch Institute. The German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (<abbr title=\"Study on the health of children and adolescents in Germany\">KiGGS</abbr>) for the period 2003&nbsp;to 2006&nbsp;delivered the first nationwide representative findings. Comparable measurement data are available for the period from 2014&nbsp;to 2017&nbsp;from the second follow-up of the <abbr title=\"Study on the health of children and adolescents in Germany\">KiGGS</abbr> study (<abbr title=\"Study on the health of children and adolescents in Germany\">KiGGS</abbr> Wave 2). To allow proper data comparison, the findings were standardised on the basis of extrapolated population data for 31&nbsp;December 2015.<br><br>For the 2014-2017&nbsp;period, 3.9% of the 3&nbsp;to 10-year-olds and 8.0% of the 11&nbsp;to 17-year-olds were classed as obese. While there were no differences between the sexes in the 3-10&nbsp;age group, the rates for the 11&nbsp;to 17-year-olds were 7.2% for girls and 8.7% for boys. In the period from 2003&nbsp;to 2006, the proportion of 3&nbsp;to 10-year-olds with obesity was about 5.2%; among the 11&nbsp;to 17-year-olds, it was about 8.3%. In that period too, girls and boys in the 3-10&nbsp;age group were equally affected. The figure for the 11-17&nbsp;age group broke down into 8.2% of the girls and 8.4% of the boys. The obesity rate has therefore fallen more sharply among 3&nbsp;to 10-year-olds than in the 11-17&nbsp;age group. While it fell by 1.0&nbsp;percentage points among girls aged 11&nbsp;to 17, it showed a slight increase of 0.3&nbsp;of a percentage point among boys in that age group.<br><br>The percentage of overweight 11-17-year-olds (> <abbr title=\"90th percentile\">P90</abbr>) had not changed substantially since the 2003-2006&nbsp;period, showing a decline of 0.6&nbsp;of a percentage point to 12.3% in the 3-10&nbsp;age group and an increase of 0.6&nbsp;of a percentage point to 18.7% among 11&nbsp;to 17-year-olds.<br><br>Key factors in becoming overweight are nutrition and exercise habits, which vary considerably when the findings are examined in the light of socio-economic status (<abbr title=\"Socioeconomic status\">SES</abbr>). The findings of <abbr title=\"Study on the health of children and adolescents in Germany\">KiGGS</abbr> Wave 2&nbsp;confirm that 3&nbsp;to 17-year-olds with a low socio-economic status more often have an unhealthy diet and more rarely take part in sport than their contemporaries with a higher socio-economic status. The risk of excess weight and obesity among 3&nbsp;to 17-year-olds with a low socio-economic status are about three to four times greater than in the high status group; each group comprises about 20% of the sample population.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.rki.de/EN/Home/homepage_node.html\">Robert Koch Institute</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.rki.de/EN/Home/homepage_node.html\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Koch Institute</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.rki.de/EN/Home/homepage_node.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"www.dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/rki.png\" alt=\"Robert Koch Institute\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationRobert Koch Institute\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","weather_active_1":true,"weather_indicator_1":"3.1.e Obesity rate among children and adolescents","weather_indicator_1_target":"Increase to be permanently halted","weather_indicator_1_target_1":"Increase to be permanently halted","weather_indicator_1_target_1_category":"normal","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a":null,"data_show_map":false,"copyright":"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2022","data_footnotes":"Data is based on a special evaluation.<br>\u2022 Age-standardized data (population status: December 31, 2015).","graph_title":"Overweight and obese 3 to 10-year-olds and 11 to 17-year-olds","precision":[{"decimals":1.0}],"span_gaps":true,"show_line":true,"graph_type":"bar","data_start_values":[{"field":"Time series","value":"Obesity rate among children and adolescents"},{"field":"Age group","value":"3 to under 11 years"},{"field":"Age group","value":"11 to under 18 years"}],"graph_stepsize":[{"step":2.0}],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"Time series","national_geographical_coverage":"Germany","page_content":"\n\n<div>\n  <div class=\"my-header\">\n    <label class=\"default\">Obesity: increase to be permanently halted\n    </label>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"my-header-note\">\n  <label class=\"default\"><b>(No evaluation possible)\n  </b></label>\n</div>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-28","national_data_updated_date":"2022-11-28","indicator_number":"3.1.e","target_number":"3.1","goal_number":"3","language":"en"}
