It is calculated by dividing the body weight in kilograms by the square of an individual\u2019s height in metres. This calculation does not take age-specific and gender-specific differences into account. Nor does it indicate the individual body mass composition. However, obesity and excess weight among children and adolescents are defined by taking account also of age and gender. In order to determine if people suffer from obesity or excess weight, the individual <abbr title=\"Body Mass Index\" tabindex=\"0\">BMI</abbr> value is compared with a defined comparison group (reference population). The percentile reference values according to Kromeyer-Hauschild as recommended by the \u201cArbeitsgemeinschaft Adipositas im Kinder- und Jugendalter\u201d are used as a comparative benchmark. According to these values, children and adolescents are considered to be overweight if their <abbr title=\"Body Mass Index\" tabindex=\"0\">BMI</abbr> value is above the 90th age- and gender-specific percentile of the reference population (> <abbr title=\"90th percentile\" tabindex=\"0\">P90</abbr>). This means that they fall within the range of those 10&nbsp;% of the reference group with the highest <abbr title=\"Body Mass Index\" tabindex=\"0\">BMI</abbr> values. A <abbr title=\"Body Mass Index\" tabindex=\"0\">BMI</abbr> value above the 97th percentile of the reference population (that is, as high as the 3&nbsp;% of adolescents with the highest <abbr title=\"Body Mass Index\" tabindex=\"0\">BMI</abbr> values) is classified as obesity (> <abbr title=\"97th percentile\" tabindex=\"0\">P97</abbr>). For example, girls and boys aged three with a <abbr title=\"Body Mass Index\" tabindex=\"0\">BMI</abbr> of 18.8&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Kilogram per square meter\" tabindex=\"0\">kg/m\u00b2</abbr> are considered to be obese. These reference values are based on details of body size and weight that were recorded between 1985&nbsp;and 1998&nbsp;in various regions of Germany, using different methods.<br><br>The data for the indicator is gathered by the Robert Koch Institute. The German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;referred to as the <abbr title=\"Study on the health of children and adolescents in Germany\" tabindex=\"0\">KiGGS</abbr> baseline study) for the period 2003&nbsp;to 2006&nbsp;delivered the first nationwide representative results. New measurement data is available for the period 2014&nbsp;to 2017&nbsp;from the second follow-up survey of the <abbr title=\"Study on the health of children and adolescents in Germany\" tabindex=\"0\">KiGGS</abbr> study (<abbr title=\"Study on the health of children and adolescents in Germany\" tabindex=\"0\">KiGGS</abbr> Wave 2). In order to allow the data to be compared in a suitable way, the results were age standardised to the reference date 31&nbsp;December 2015&nbsp;of the intercensal population update.<br><br>For the time period 2014&nbsp;to 2017, 3.9&nbsp;% of the 3&nbsp;to 10-year-olds and 8.0&nbsp;% of the 11&nbsp;to 17-year-olds were classified as obese. While there were no differences between the sexes in the 3&nbsp;to 10&nbsp;years age group, the rates for the 11&nbsp;to 17-year-olds were 7.2&nbsp;% for girls and 8.7&nbsp;% for boys. In the period from 2003&nbsp;to 2006, the proportion of 3&nbsp;to 10-year-olds with obesity was about 5.2&nbsp;%; among the 11&nbsp;to 17-year olds, it was about 8.3&nbsp;%. Again, girls and boys in the age from 3&nbsp;to 10&nbsp;years were equally affected. The figure for the 11&nbsp;to 17-year-olds broke down into 8.2&nbsp;% of the girls and 8.4&nbsp;% of the boys. The obesity rate has therefore fallen more sharply among 3&nbsp;to 10-year-olds than in the 11&nbsp;to 17&nbsp;age group. While it fell by 1.0&nbsp;percentage points among girls aged 11&nbsp;to 17, it showed a slight increase of 0.3&nbsp;percentage points among boys in that age group.<br><br>The proportion of adolescents suffering from excess weight including obesity (> <abbr title=\"90th percentile\" tabindex=\"0\">P90</abbr>) did not change much compared with the period 2003&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;2006&nbsp;(decrease by 0.6&nbsp;percentage points to 12.3&nbsp;% for 3&nbsp;to 10-year olds, increase by 0.6&nbsp;percentage points to 18.7&nbsp;% for 11&nbsp;to 17-year-olds).<br><br>Important factors in the development of overweight are dietary and exercise behaviour, which differ&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;when looking at the results&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;in terms of socioeconomic status (<abbr title=\"Socioeconomic status\" tabindex=\"0\">SES</abbr>). The results from <abbr title=\"Study on the health of children and adolescents in Germany\" tabindex=\"0\">KiGGS</abbr> Wave 2&nbsp;confirm that 3&nbsp;to 17-year-old children and adolescents with a low socioeconomic status eat unhealthy more often than their peers from socially better-off families and exercise less frequently. The risk of overweight and obesity is about 3&nbsp;to 4&nbsp;times higher for children and adolescents with low <abbr title=\"Socioeconomic status\" tabindex=\"0\">SES</abbr> than in the upper status group (about 20&nbsp;% of the study population).","embedded_feature_html":"<p>Additional data series for the indicator can be found <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/AddInfos/en/3_1_e.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" >here</a>.</p><br><small>Note: You can display the PDF document directly in your browser or download the PDF document and open it with a PDF reader of your choice.
