The goal is therefore to continuously increase Germany\u2019s contribution to international soil protection until 2030. At the international level, combating desertification is one of the topics of the three Rio Conventions, alongside biodiversity and climate change.","data_state":"The data published in the indicator report 2022 is as of Oct 31 2022.
