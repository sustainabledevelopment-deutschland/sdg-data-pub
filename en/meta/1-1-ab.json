In the 2020&nbsp;survey year, EU-SILC underwent extensive methodological revisions and was integrated into the microcensus in response to increasing demands for up-to-date data and the provision of more detailed regional results. As a result of this realignment, the data from 2020&nbsp;onwards is not comparable with that of previous years.<br><br>As part of the development of the Europe 2030&nbsp;targets, the previous indicator of <i>material deprivation</i> was revised and expanded to include aspects of social deprivation. Since 2021, it has therefore been referred to as the indicator of <i>material and social deprivation</i>. Individuals affected by material and social deprivation experience significantly restricted living conditions due to a lack of financial resources. They, or the household in which they live, are unable to afford at least five of the following thirteen specified items&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;in the case of severe material and social deprivation, this applies to at least seven of the thirteen items:<br><br>The household cannot afford:<br><br>1. to pay rent, mortgage instalments, utility bills, or consumer/instalment loans on time;<br>2. to keep the home adequately warm;<br>3. to cover unexpected expenses of a certain amount from their own resources;<br>4. to eat a meal containing meat, fish or a vegetarian equivalent every other day;<br>5. to take a one-week holiday away from home each year;<br>6. to own a car (excluding company or business cars);<br>7. to replace worn-out furniture.<br><br>The individual cannot afford:<br><br>8. to replace worn-out clothes with new (not second-hand) garments;<br>9. to own at least two pairs of properly fitting shoes in good condition;<br>10. to spend a small amount of money each week on themselves;<br>11. to participate regularly in leisure activities (even if they involve costs);<br>12. to meet with friends or family for a drink or meal at least once a month;<br>13. to have an internet connection.<br><br>The six individual indicators (points 8&nbsp;to 13) are only collected for persons aged 16&nbsp;and over. For children under 16, the data is derived from the responses of household members aged 16&nbsp;and over. The rule applied is: if at least half of the household members aged 16&nbsp;or over report being unable to afford a specific item (such as replacing worn-out clothes), this is assumed to apply to the children under 16&nbsp;in that household as well. In addition, it is assessed whether children under 16&nbsp;live in a disadvantaged household&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;that is, whether at least three of the seven household-level criteria are met (such as not being able to heat the home adequately).<br><br>To ensure data comparability, the Statistical Office of the European Union (Eurostat) has recalculated figures for years prior to 2021&nbsp;based on the new indicator. Over time, deprivation rates in the EU have consistently been higher than those in Germany. According to Eurostat calculations, in 2024, 12.1% of the EU population were affected by material and social deprivation. This figure was 0.7&nbsp;percentage points higher than the corresponding figure for Germany, which stood at 11.4%. The difference was smaller in the case of severe material and social deprivation: in 2024, 6.2% of the population in Germany were affected&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;only 0.2&nbsp;percentage points below the EU average. The politically determined target was therefore met in 2024&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;although in the case of severe deprivation, only narrowly.<br><br>Clearer differences emerge within Germany across age groups. The deprivation rate among those under the age of 16&nbsp;stood at 13.0%, above the national average, whereas it was only 8.1% for those aged 65&nbsp;and over. A similar pattern appears with regard to severe material and social deprivation: 7.5% of under-16s were affected, compared to just 4.3% of people aged 65&nbsp;and over. When examining individual deprivationcriteria, some marked differences can also be observed. While comparatively few respondents reported being unable to afford an internet connection (2.5%) or at least two pairs of shoes in good condition (3.9%), around one-third (32.2%) stated that they could not cover unexpected expenses from their own financial resources.</p>","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/home\" target=\"_blank\"
