The two indicators represent the proportion of people out of the total population who are deemed to suffer either material deprivation (1.1.a) or severe material deprivation (1.1.b). The designation of (severe) material deprivation applies to all people whose household meets at least three (severely materially deprived: at least four) of nine defined criteria reflecting the financial restrictions of the household.","dns_indicator_intention":"The indicator \u201cmaterial deprivation\u201d also is part of the extensive reporting on poverty and wealth conducted by the Federal Government. By identifying individual deficiencies, it aims to act as a substitute for illustrating living conditions threatened by poverty. The target is to combat material deprivation, therefore both, the percentage of persons who are materially as well as severely materially deprived, should stay below the level within the European Union.","data_state":"The data published in the indicator report 2022 is as of Oct 31 2022. The data shown on this platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/facts_publications/\">indicator report 2022</a>.","indicator_name":"Material deprivation and severe material deprivation","section":"Poverty","postulate":"Limiting poverty","target_id":"1.1.1","previous":"17-3","next":"2-1-a","content_and_progress":"<b>Text from the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/facts_publications/\">Indicator Report 2022&nbsp;</a></b><br><br>The data is drawn from the Europe-wide harmonised annual Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (<abbr title=\"EU-Statistics on Income and Living Conditions\" tabindex=\"0\">EU-SILC</abbr>), and are incorporated with extensive methodological changes into the microcensus due to increasing requirements on data with respect to actuality and provision of more detailed regional results in survey year 2020. As a consequence, the results since survey year 2020&nbsp;are not comparable with prior survey years. <br><br>The selected survey variables are expenditures based on a lifestyle that is considered appropriate, desirable or even necessary in Europe. These nine criteria used to characterise material deprivation are standardised across all countries in which <abbr title=\"EU-Statistics on Income and Living Conditions\" tabindex=\"0\">EU-SILC</abbr> is conducted, thereby allowing Europe-wide comparisons. Survey results are derived from self-assessment of households. According to the definition of <abbr title=\"EU-Statistics on Income and Living Conditions\" tabindex=\"0\">EU-SILC</abbr>, households are characterized to suffer from (severe) material deprivation, if they fulfill at least three (severe material deprivation: at least four) of the following nine criteria:<br><br>   1.\tFinancial difficulties to pay for rent, mortgages, or utility bills on time.<br><br>   2.\tFinancial difficulties to ensure adequate heating in the residence.<br><br>   3.\tFinancial difficulties to meet unplanned expenditures of a specific amount from one\u2019s own financial resources.<br><br>   4.\tFinancial difficulties to eat meat, fish or an equivalent vegetarian meal every second day.<br><br>   5.\tFinancial difficulties to spend one week\u2019s holidays per year outside the actual residence.<br><br>   6.\tLack of a car in the household due to financial reasons.<br><br>   7.\tLack of a washing machine in the household due to financial reasons.<br><br>   8.\tLack of a colour TV in the household due to financial reasons.<br><br>   9.\tLack of a telephone in the household due to financial reasons.<br><br>Until 2019, both indicators declined over time for Germany similar to the decline in the European Union (<abbr title=\"European Union\" tabindex=\"0\">EU</abbr>), while the mean values for individuals living in the <abbr title=\"European Union\" tabindex=\"0\">EU</abbr> were considerably higher than mean values for Germany.<br><br>A comparison of data for Germany of year 2020&nbsp;with prior years is due to adjustments in the survey method not feasible. Because of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the <abbr title=\"European Union\" tabindex=\"0\">EU</abbr> (Brexit) a revaluation was required in 2020&nbsp;without the United Kingdom being part of the <abbr title=\"European Union\" tabindex=\"0\">EU</abbr> (<abbr title=\"European Union consisting of 27&nbsp;member states (without United Kingdom)\" tabindex=\"0\">EU-27</abbr>).<br><br>According to calculations of the Statistical Office of the European Union (<abbr title=\"European Statistical Office\" tabindex=\"0\">Eurostat</abbr>), 11.9&nbsp;% of European residents were affected by material deprivation in 2021. This value is 3.1&nbsp;percentage points above the value for Germany that is 8.8&nbsp;% and, hence, is still considerably above the German reference value. However, the share of severely materially deprived individuals was 5.6&nbsp;% in 2020&nbsp;(more recent data was not available at the time of going to press) for Germany and is only 0.3&nbsp;percentage points below <abbr title=\"European Union\" tabindex=\"0\">EU</abbr> level. The targets of the Federal Government were achieved (although severe material deprivation was just below <abbr title=\"European Union\" tabindex=\"0\">EU</abbr>-level).<br><br>The indicator to \u201cmaterial deprivation\u201d was redefined and expanded as part of the development of the Europe 2030-targets and allows for additional criteria for social deprivation. In 2021, a share of 6.3&nbsp;% of the <abbr title=\"European Union\" tabindex=\"0\">EU</abbr> population were considered to be \u201cseverely materially and socially deprived\u201c, while the value for Germany was 4.2&nbsp;%.<br><br>The indicator \u201cRate of (severe) social and material deprivation\u201d was advanced on European level and is supposed to replace the existing national indicator \u201cRate of (severe) material deprivation\u201d as part of a new version of the German strategy for sustainable development.","embedded_feature_html":"<p>Additional data series for the indicator can be found(<a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/public/AddInfos/en/1_1_ab.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" >here</a>.</p><br><small>Note: You can display the PDF document directly in your browser or download the PDF document and open it with a PDF reader of your choice.
