The German Government has therefore set itself the target of doubling the proportion of its imports that come from <abbr title=\"Least developed countries\" tabindex=\"0\">LDCs</abbr> between 2014&nbsp;and 2030.","data_state":"The data published in the indicator report 2022 is as of Oct 31 2022. The data shown on this platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/facts_publications/\">indicator report 2022</a>.","indicator_name":"Imports from least developed countries","section":"Opening markets","postulate":"Improving trade opportunities for developing countries","target_id":"17.3.1","previous":"17-2","next":"1-1-ab","content_and_progress":"<b>Text from the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/facts_publications/\">Indicator Report 2021&nbsp;</a></b><br><br>Information about imports to Germany is compiled from the foreign-trade statistics of the Federal Statistical Office. The type of the goods imported is recorded in detail in addition to their country of origin, value and weight. The service sector is not included in the foreign-trade statistics.<br><br>The various countries\u2019 classification as <abbr title=\"Least developed countries\" tabindex=\"0\">LDCs</abbr> is taken from the list of <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\" tabindex=\"0\">ODA</abbr> recipients maintained by the <abbr title=\"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\" tabindex=\"0\">OECD</abbr>\u2019s Development Assistance Committee (<abbr title=\"Development Assistance Committee\" tabindex=\"0\">DAC</abbr>). The indicator uses the list of <abbr title=\"Least developed countries\" tabindex=\"0\">LDCs</abbr> valid according to the <abbr title=\"Development Assistance Committee\" tabindex=\"0\">DAC</abbr> for each particular reporting years. If the status of a country changes, this will have an impact on the indicator even if the value of imports from that country remains unchanged. However, changes in countries\u2019 status have scarcely affected the development of the indicator in the period shown.<br><br>The issue of reimports means that the possibility of duplicate entries in the numerator and denominator of the indicator cannot be ruled out. The fact that the imports from <abbr title=\"Least developed countries\" tabindex=\"0\">LDCs</abbr> are viewed in relation to all German imports must also be taken into account. The consequence is that the value of the indicator depends not only on the absolute quantity of imports from <abbr title=\"Least developed countries\" tabindex=\"0\">LDCs</abbr> but also on the value of all imports.<br><br>Alongside Germany\u2019s total imports from <abbr title=\"Least developed countries\" tabindex=\"0\">LDCs</abbr>, the indicator also shows what share is made up of processed products. The intention here is to address the question, at least to some extent, as to whether Germany mainly uses <abbr title=\"Least developed countries\" tabindex=\"0\">LDCs</abbr> as sources of basic materials for industrially produced goods or whether the <abbr title=\"Least developed countries\" tabindex=\"0\">LDCs</abbr> themselves have a stake in the manufacturing process and the associated value creation. These include all goods not classified as raw materials in the classification according to product groups of the food and industrial economy (<abbr title=\"Classification of goods in the food and industrial economy in Foreign Trade Statistics\" tabindex=\"0\">EGW</abbr>). The term thus does not encompass products extracted from nature and not or hardly processed, such as petroleum, ores, timber in the rough or vegetable textile fibres. Conversely, cereals, vegetables, live animals, meat and milk are classified as processed products.<br><br>Imports from <abbr title=\"Least developed countries\" tabindex=\"0\">LDCs</abbr> accounted for 0.94% of all imports to Germany in 2019&nbsp;and were valued at <abbr title=\"Euro\" tabindex=\"0\">EUR</abbr> 10.4&nbsp;billion. This equates to an increase of 116% compared with 2002, when that share was just 0.44%. However, the positive trend only goes back to 2008. The share of imports of processed products from <abbr title=\"Least developed countries\" tabindex=\"0\">LDCs</abbr> rose even more sharply between 2002&nbsp;and 2019&nbsp;(+151%). It reached 0.89% of total imports to Germany in 2019&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;compared to 0.36% in 2002&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;which equates to a value of around <abbr title=\"Euro\" tabindex=\"0\">EUR</abbr> 9.9&nbsp;billion. That share has stagnated in the last three reporting years. Nonetheless, if the increase over the last five years continues, is it to be expected that the benchmark will be reached.<br><br>Closer analysis of the various countries of origin reveals that almost three quarters of Germany\u2019s imports from <abbr title=\"Least developed countries\" tabindex=\"0\">LDCs</abbr> in 2019&nbsp;came from Bangladesh (57%) or Cambodia (16%). If one looks not only at the <abbr title=\"Least developed countries\" tabindex=\"0\">LDCs</abbr> but at all developing and emerging countries, their share of total imports to Germany in 2019&nbsp;was 21.8%, and processed products from those countries accounted for 20.11% (up from 13.67% and 12.17% respectively in 2002). Imports from <abbr title=\"Least developed countries\" tabindex=\"0\">LDCs</abbr>, both in terms of all goods and in terms of processed goods, thus account for a rather small share of imports from developing and emerging countries. As is shown above, however, their share of Germany\u2019s total imports has increased more dramatically over time. Not only among developing and emerging countries but also more generally, China plays the most major role. Of all German imports in 2019, 9.97% came from China alone, with processed goods making up 9.94%.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/destatis.png\" alt=\"Federal Statistical Office\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Statistical Office\" style=\"height:60px;
