Developing and emerging countries need an open and fair trading system that will allow them to offer raw materials as well as processed products on the world market.

These statistics record not only the country of origin of imported goods but also their value, weight, and a detailed product classification. While data on imports of services are collected by the Deutsche Bundesbank, they are not taken into account in the calculation of this indicator.<br><br>The classification of countries as Least Developed Countries (LDCs) is based on the list of recipients of Official Development Assistance (ODA) maintained by the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD-DAC). For the purposes of this indicator, the applicable LDC classification in each respective year as defined by the OECD-DAC is used. If a country's status changes, this affects the indicator&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;even if the import value from that country remains unchanged. Due to re-imports&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;including those following processing steps abroad&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;a certain degree of double counting in both the numerator and denominator of the indicator must be assumed.<br><br>Since imports from LDCs are always measured in relation to total German imports, the indicator value depends not only on the absolute volume of imports from LDCs but also on the total value of Germany\u2019s imports in a given year. In addition to total imports from LDCs, the indicator also includes the share of processed goods. This is intended to partially reflect whether Germany primarily imports raw materials from LDCs for industrial production or whether LDCs themselves are involved in the manufacturing process and value creation.<br><br>Processed goods are defined as all products that are not classified as raw materials according to the grouping by product categories and subcategories of the food and manufacturing industries (EGW). Raw materials such as crude oil, ores, roundwood or vegetable textile fibres are excluded, whereas items such as cereals, vegetables, live animals, meat and milk are considered processed products.<br><br>In 2024, according to preliminary calculations, the share of imports from LDCs in total German imports amounted to 1.17%, or 15.3&nbsp;billion euros. This represents an increase of 64.0% since 2014&nbsp;(2014: 0.71%). The share of processed products from LDCs grew by 60.1% between 2014&nbsp;and 2024, reaching 1.05% of total German imports in 2024&nbsp;(2014: 0.66%). This corresponds to a value of 13.8&nbsp;billion euros. Despite a temporary decline in 2023, the indicator overall moved in the desired direction and, if the current trend continues, is on track to meet the politically defined target for 2030.<br><br>A more detailed analysis of imports by country of origin shows that in 2024, the majority of imports from LDCs originated from Bangladesh (55.0%) and Cambodia (14.4%). When considering not only the LDCs but all developing and emerging economies, their share of total German imports in 2024&nbsp;stood at 25.8%, with processed goods accounting for 23.6%. Among developing and emerging economies&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;and indeed across all countries&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;Germany imported the most from China in 2024. The share of imports from China in total German imports (1,307.8&nbsp;billion euros) amounted to 11.9%, with 99.7% of the value attributable to processed goods. The Netherlands (7.2%) and the United States (7.0%) followed as the second and third most important import partners respectively.</p>","download_content":"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/indicator_downloads_de/17-3.pdf","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/destatis.png\" alt=\"Federal Statistical Office\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Statistical Office\" style=\"height:60px;
