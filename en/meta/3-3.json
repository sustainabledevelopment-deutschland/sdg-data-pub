Programmes are taken into account in the analyses whose objectives fall directly under the heading of pandemic prevention and response or who are primarily intended to enhance relevant capabilities in the field of health care.<br><br>The programmes cover matters such as the pandemic prevention and response functions of the World Health Organization (WHO), sanitation, One Health (that is, in interdisciplinary cooperation between human and veterinary medicine and the environmental sector), vaccination infrastructure and research and development, both at home and abroad, in so far as the R&D findings and innovations also benefit the countries of the Global South. Additionally, programmes launched in response to the COVID-19&nbsp;pandemic have also been taken into account. The latter include among others WHO programmes and activities, humanitarian aid, vaccine development, crisis response and emergency assistance and loans to help health services in countries of the Global South to respond to the crisis. <br><br>As regards the figures, it should be noted that it is not possible to draw hard and fast lines between the content of programmes, since the indicator field is closely interlinked with numerous other areas of the health system. The indicator therefore takes account of a range of programmes, such as Germany\u2019s contribution to the WHO to support its emergency programme and to provide flexible initial funding for crisis response measures through the Contingency Fund for Emergencies, support for a vaccination programme for the reduction of child mortality in the East African Community, improvement of drinking water supply and sanitation in Burkina Faso and a biosecurity cooperation programme.<br><br>Besides the thematic prioritisation, it should also be noted that some of the programmes are focused on general reinforcement of global coordination and organisational capacity and therefore do not exclusively benefit countries of the Global South. Nor can a precise line be drawn between preventive and reactive measures. Developing preventive capacity may, for example, enhance responsiveness to a pandemic situation, while reactive measures may contribute to capacity-building in the long term.<br><br>To avoid a statistical outlier resulting from the response to the COVID-19&nbsp;pandemic, these expenditure items and pledges are not part of the indicators but are shown separately in the chart. The amounts of expenditure and pledges that are displayed, moreover, say nothing about the success of the programmes. The indicator represents Germany\u2019s monetary contribution to pandemic prevention and response. A more extensive assessment would be needed to gauge the impact of that contribution. In view of the foregoing provisos, therefore, the recorded figures are not by any means a full reflection of the German expenditure and pledges that directly or indirectly influence the pandemic prevention and response effort.<br><br>Between 2015&nbsp;and 2021, expenditure and pledges for pandemic prevention and response rose from EUR 147.9&nbsp;million to EUR 369.7&nbsp;million (provisional figure) and were thus &#8209; in line with the Federal Government's target &#8209; significantly above the 2019&nbsp;figure. The separately reported expenditures on COVID-19&nbsp;pandemic containment were 842.7&nbsp;million euros in 2021, higher than in the first year of the pandemic (743.7&nbsp;million euros).</p>","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the Federal Foreign Office', 'En')\">Federal Foreign Office</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the Federal Foreign Office', 'En')\">Federal Foreign Office</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the Federal Foreign Office', 'En')\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/aa.png\" alt=\"Federal Foreign Office\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Foreign Office\" style=\"height:60px;
