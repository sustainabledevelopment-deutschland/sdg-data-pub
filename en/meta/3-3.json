It excludes programmes designed to contain the <abbr title=\"Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2\" tabindex=\"0\">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;pandemic. To make the indicator more informative, its impact will be assessed by the time of the next edition of the German National Sustainability Strategy with a view to developing it into an output indicator.","dns_indicator_intention":"The <abbr title=\"Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2\" tabindex=\"0\">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;pandemic has shown what far-reaching effects cross-border health hazards have on people and economies throughout the world. Accordingly, supporting pandemic prevention and response programmes is a major contribution to global health, particularly in countries of the Global South. The aim is therefore to increase Germany\u2019s contribution to global pandemic prevention and response substantially from its 2019&nbsp;level in the period up to 2030.","data_state":"The data published in the indicator report 2022 is as of Oct 31 2022. The data shown on this platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/facts_publications/\">indicator report 2022</a>.","indicator_name":"Germany\u2019s contribution to global pandemic prevention and response","section":"Global health","postulate":"Strengthening the global health architecture","target_id":"3.3.1","previous":"3-2-b","next":"4-1-a","content_and_progress":"<b>Text from the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/facts_publications/\">Indicator Report 2022&nbsp;</a></b><br><br>The data for the indicator come from special analyses of the relevant budget headings and commitment appropriations from the Federal Foreign Office, the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, the Federal Ministry of Health and the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development. Programmes are taken into account in the analyses if, by dint of their objectives, they fall directly under the heading of pandemic prevention and response or if they are primarily intended to enhance relevant capabilities in the field of health care. The programmes cover matters such as the pandemic prevention and response functions of the World Health Organization (<abbr title=\"World Health Organization\" tabindex=\"0\">WHO</abbr>), sanitation, One Health (a holistic approach that recognises the interconnection between human, animal and environmental health), vaccination infrastructure and research and development, both at home and abroad, in so far as the <abbr title=\"Research and development\" tabindex=\"0\">R&D</abbr> findings and innovations also benefit the countries of the Global South. Additionally, programmes launched in response to the <abbr title=\"Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2\" tabindex=\"0\">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;pandemic have also been taken into account. The latter include <abbr title=\"World Health Organization\" tabindex=\"0\">WHO</abbr> programmes and activities, humanitarian aid, vaccine development, crisis response and emergency assistance and loans to help health services in countries of the Global South to respond to the crisis. By definition, expenditure and pledges made in response to the <abbr title=\"Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2\" tabindex=\"0\">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;pandemic are excluded from the indicator and shown separately.<br><br>As regards the figures, it should be noted that it is not possible to draw hard and fast lines between the content of programmes, since the indicator field is closely interlinked with numerous other areas of the health system. The indicator therefore takes account of a range of programmes, such as Germany\u2019s contribution to the <abbr title=\"World Health Organization\" tabindex=\"0\">WHO</abbr> to support its emergency programme and to provide flexible initial funding for crisis response measures through the Contingency Fund for Emergencies, support for a vaccination programme for the reduction of child mortality in the East African Community, improvement of drinking water supply and sanitation in Burkina Faso and a biosecurity cooperation programme. Besides the thematic prioritisation, it should also be noted that some of the programmes are focused on general reinforcement of global coordination and organisational capacity and therefore do not exclusively benefit countries of the Global South.<br><br>Nor can a precise line be drawn between preventive and reactive measures. Developing preventive capacity may, for example, enhance responsiveness to a pandemic situation, while reactive measures may contribute to capacity-building in the long term. To avoid a statistical outlier resulting from the response to the <abbr title=\"Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2\" tabindex=\"0\">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;pandemic, these expenditure items and pledges are not part of the indicators but are shown separately in the chart.<br><br>The amounts of expenditure and pledges that are displayed, moreover, say nothing about the success of the programmes. The indicator represents Germany\u2019s monetary contribution to pandemic prevention and response. A more extensive assessment would be needed to gauge the impact of that contribution. In view of the foregoing provisos, therefore, the recorded figures are not by any means a full reflection of the German expenditure and pledges that directly or indirectly influence the pandemic prevention and response effort.<br><br>Between the years 2015&nbsp;and 2020, expenditure and pledges for pandemic prevention and response rose from <abbr title=\"Euro\" tabindex=\"0\">EUR</abbr> 137.9&nbsp;million to <abbr title=\"Euro\" tabindex=\"0\">EUR</abbr> 353.1&nbsp;million (provisional figure). This represents an average annual increase of <abbr title=\"Euro\" tabindex=\"0\">EUR</abbr> 43.1&nbsp;million over those last five years. If this trend continued, the objective of increasing Germany\u2019s contribution substantially from 2019&nbsp;to 2030&nbsp;would be achieved. The chart also clearly shows the upsurge of <abbr title=\"Euro\" tabindex=\"0\">EUR</abbr> 635.2&nbsp;million in expenditure and pledges in 2020&nbsp;to contain the <abbr title=\"Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2\" tabindex=\"0\">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;pandemic.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/en/\">Federal Ministry of Health</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Ministry of Health</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/en/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/bmg.png\" alt=\"Federal Ministry of Health\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Ministry of Health\" style=\"height:60px;
