The data shown on this platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/facts_publications/\">indicator report 2022</a>.","indicator_name":"Persons with an academic or higher vocational qualification","section":"Education","postulate":"Continuously improving education and vocational training","target_id":"4.1.1","previous":"4-1-a","next":"4-2-ab","content_and_progress":"<b>Text from the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/facts_publications/\">Indicator Report 2022&nbsp;</a></b><br><br>The name of the indicator is linked to the tradition of the dual education system in Germany. In addition to tertiary degrees from universities, universities of applied sciences, colleges of public administration, vocational and specialised academies as well as master craftsmen\u2019s and technicians\u2019 certificates, there are post-secondary non-tertiary degrees at upper secondary level which are obtained in parallel or consecutively. These include, for example, the \u201cAbitur\u201d (higher education entrance qualification) at evening schools or at two-year full-time vocational schools, the completion of vocational training after the \u201cAbitur\u201d or a previous vocational training.<br><br>The \u201cInternational Standard Classification of Education (<abbr title=\"International Standard Classification of Education\" tabindex=\"0\">ISCED</abbr>)\u201d enables international comparisons of statistics and indicators regarding certificates of education. Certificates that are regarded as equivalent are assigned to the same <abbr title=\"International Standard Classification of Education\" tabindex=\"0\">ISCED</abbr> levels. Therefore, the indicator includes both the tertiary degrees corresponding to levels 5&nbsp;to 8&nbsp;of the <abbr title=\"International Standard Classification of Education\" tabindex=\"0\">ISCED</abbr> as well as the post-secondary non-tertiary degrees corresponding to level 4&nbsp;of the <abbr title=\"International Standard Classification of Education\" tabindex=\"0\">ISCED</abbr>.<br><br>The data for the indicator originate from the microcensus, whose annual sample survey covers 1&nbsp;% of the population. The statistics of higher education provides supplementary information and is also compiled by the Federal Statistical Office.<br><br>Starting at 33.4&nbsp;% in 1999, the indicator increased by 19.9&nbsp;percentage points to 53.2&nbsp;% in 2021. If the average growth rate of the last five reference years is maintained, the target value of 55&nbsp;% could be achieved considerably earlier than 2030. The relation between the gender-specific percentages has changed over time. In 1999, the indicator for men was 3.8&nbsp;percentage points higher than for women. In 2006, the values were the same for both sexes. Since 2007, the percentage of women with a tertiary or post-secondary non-tertiary qualification has been higher than that of men and exceeded the target value for 2030&nbsp;already in year 2021&nbsp;(57.2&nbsp;%), while the proportion of men, which was 49.6&nbsp;% in 2021, would reach the target a good bit later.<br><br>Many other countries do not offer post-secondary non-tertiary education programmes. Therefore, the European version of the indicator from the \u201cEurope 2020\u201d strategy is more narrowly defined and takes only tertiary degrees (<abbr title=\"International Standard Classification of Education\" tabindex=\"0\">ISCED</abbr> levels 5-8) into account.<br><br>Following a steady increase since 2005, the European indicator reached a total of 41.6&nbsp;% across the <abbr title=\"European Union consisting of 27&nbsp;member states (without United Kingdom)\" tabindex=\"0\">EU-27</abbr>&nbsp;states in 2021. If one also uses this more narrowly defined indicator for Germany, the value of 37.8&nbsp;% obtained for 2021&nbsp;was more than 3.8&nbsp;percentage points below the <abbr title=\"European Union\" tabindex=\"0\">EU</abbr> value. Furthermore, in 2021, the proportion of women (38.6&nbsp;%) was higher than that of men (37.0&nbsp;%).<br><br>The number of university graduates in Germany totalled 517,944&nbsp;in 2021. This was more than twice as many as in 1999. These included 129,488&nbsp;engineering graduates (three times as much than in 1999) and 54,928&nbsp;graduates of mathematics and the natural sciences (68.8&nbsp;% more than in 1999).","embedded_feature_html":"<p>Additional data series for the indicator can be found(<a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/public/AddInfos/en/4_1_b.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" >here</a>.</p><br><small>Note: You can display the PDF document directly in your browser or download the PDF document and open it with a PDF reader of your choice.
