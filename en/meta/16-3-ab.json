Depending on the survey, underlying definitions of corruption may differ, and the sources used for calculations may change over time. The index includes all countries for which at least three selected surveys are available. As such, the <abbr title=\"Corruption Perception Index\" tabindex=\"0\">CPI</abbr> is the most comprehensive synoptic study on perceived public sector corruption.<br><br>In its analysis of the <abbr title=\"Corruption Perception Index\" tabindex=\"0\">CPI</abbr>, the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission points out that interpretation of the findings should take into account whether a change is statistically significant and that the outcomes in this indicator should be treated with caution even where this is the case.<br><br>Germany\u2019s score improved from 79&nbsp;in 2012&nbsp;to 80&nbsp;in 2019.

In this case, the change compared with 2012&nbsp;cannot be considered statistically significant (at a significance level of 5%).<br><br>The Federal Statistical Office also gathers information on corruption as part of its satisfaction survey on public services. According to that survey, 4.7% of the population formed the impression during their interaction with public institutions in 2019&nbsp;that public-service employees were susceptible to corruption.

In 2019, these included 913&nbsp;cases of corruptibility, bribery, or acceptance or granting of advantages in the public sector. The Police Crime Statistics also list cases of corruptibility and bribery in commercial practice as well as what are referred to as offences associated with corruption, such as fraud and breach of trust, falsification of documents, anti-competitive agreements during tendering procedures, obstruction of justice, false certification by officials and breach of official secrecy.<br><br>Turning to German development cooperation, a total of 43&nbsp;of the 85&nbsp;partner countries evaluated in the <abbr title=\"Corruption Perception Index\" tabindex=\"0\">CPI</abbr> improved in 2019&nbsp;compared with 2012.
