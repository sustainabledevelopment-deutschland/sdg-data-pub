Final energy refers to the energy directly used in transport&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;such as petrol or diesel fuel. Conversion losses during the production of fuels, as well as potential transmission losses, are not taken into account.<br><br>The underlying data is sourced from the <abbr title=\"Transport Emission Model\" tabindex=\"0\">TREMOD</abbr> database (Transport Emission Model) developed by the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research (<abbr title=\"Institute for Energy and Environmental Research Heidelberg\" tabindex=\"0\">ifeu</abbr>). This model is used to assess transport-related emissions and captures domestic fuel consumption, regardless of the place of refuelling. Air freight is excluded from the analysis due to its relatively minor share of total freight volume. Due to the definitional limitation to domestic <abbr title=\"Final energy consumption\" tabindex=\"0\">FEC</abbr>, the indicator reflects the effects of increasing international economic integration of Germany\u2019s economy only to a limited extent.<br><br>In 2023, freight transport accounted for 26.1%<sup>1</sup> of total transport-related final energy consumption.

Between 2015&nbsp;and 2021, the number of tonne-kilometres travelled rose by 8.4%, interrupted only by a brief decline in 2020.

In 2023, <abbr title=\"Final energy consumption\" tabindex=\"0\">FEC</abbr> per tonne-kilometre stood at 94.1% of the 2015&nbsp;value&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;the lowest level in eight years.<br><br><abbr title=\"Final energy consumption\" tabindex=\"0\">FEC</abbr> has declined across all modes of freight transport compared to 2015.
