Final energy refers to the energy directly used in transport, such as petrol or diesel fuel. Transformation losses during fuel production as well as potential transmission losses are not taken into account. Data on domestic transport-related FEC originate from the Transport Emission Model (<abbr title=\"Transport Emission Model\" tabindex=\"0\">TREMOD</abbr>) database of the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research (<abbr title=\"Institute for Energy and Environmental Research\" tabindex=\"0\">ifeu</abbr>). <abbr title=\"Transport Emission Model\" tabindex=\"0\">TREMOD</abbr> is a model designed to assess transport emissions. Fuel consumption within Germany is recorded regardless of where refuelling takes place.<br><br>The same model also provides data on freight transport performance. Air freight is excluded due to its comparatively small share. Because the indicator is defined to cover only domestic FEC, the effects of increasing international interconnections of the German economy within the context of globalisation are inadequately reflected.<br><br>The politically established target for this indicator is to reduce final energy consumption in freight transport by 15&nbsp;% to 20&nbsp;% from 2005&nbsp;to 2030.<br><br>In addition to energy consumption, energy efficiency is also presented, defined as energy consumption per tonne-kilometre. The number of tonne-kilometres provides insight into how transport performance&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;that is, the amount of freight transported in tonnes multiplied by the distance travelled in kilometres&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;has changed.<br><br>In 2023, the FEC caused by freight transport amounted to 26.1&nbsp;%<sup>1</sup> of total final energy consumption in the transport sector.<br><br>In 2023, FEC in freight transport fell below the 2005&nbsp;level for the first time since 2013, showing a decline of 1.3&nbsp;%. Combined with an increase in freight transport performance of 94&nbsp;billion tonne-kilometres compared to 2005, this resulted in a significant efficiency improvement of 15.4&nbsp;% in 2023&nbsp;relative to 2005. If the recent trend continues, the minimum reduction target of 15&nbsp;% compared to 2005&nbsp;by 2030&nbsp;is likely to be narrowly achieved.<br><br>Road freight transport\u2019s FEC in 2023&nbsp;was approximately at the 2005&nbsp;level (+0.3&nbsp;%). In contrast, energy consumption for freight transport by rail and inland waterways decreased substantially (\u20137.1&nbsp;% and \u201339.8&nbsp;%, respectively).<br><br>During the global financial and economic crisis in 2009, inflation-adjusted gross value added in the manufacturing sector declined sharply by almost 20&nbsp;%. This significant downturn particularly impacted the transport sector, which directly responds to fluctuations in goods production. The resulting lower utilisation of transport capacities explains the slight increase in average energy consumption per tonne-kilometre, despite the overall substantial decline in absolute energy consumption during the crisis years.<br><br>Following the crisis, the transport industry recovered rapidly. After freight performance in 2009&nbsp;nearly fell to the 2005&nbsp;level, it had already risen by 8.2&nbsp;% by 2010. By 2015, the pre-crisis level of 2008&nbsp;had been surpassed, and the increase continued with 12.8&nbsp;% growth until 2019&nbsp;compared to 2010. Since energy consumption during this period increased by only 8.5&nbsp;%, this resulted in an efficiency improvement of 3.8&nbsp;%. In the first year of the <abbr title=\"Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2\" tabindex=\"0\">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;pandemic, this trend reversed: energy consumption declined by 2.8&nbsp;% compared to 2019, and freight volume dropped by 3.8&nbsp;%. The impact of the pandemic on freight transport was thus less severe than in passenger transport (see Indicator 11.2.b). Overall, freight transport experienced a slight efficiency deterioration of 1.0&nbsp;%.<br><br><small><sup>1</sup> The sum of the shares of freight transport (Indicator 11.2.a) and passenger transport (Indicator 11.2.b) in total final energy consumption in transport does not equal 100&nbsp;%.
