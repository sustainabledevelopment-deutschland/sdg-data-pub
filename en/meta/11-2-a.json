Final energy refers to the energy directly used in transport&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;such as petrol or diesel fuel. Transformation losses during the production of fuels, as well as potential transmission losses, are not taken into account. The underlying data is sourced from the TREMOD database (Transport Emission Model) developed by the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research (ifeu). This model is used to assess transport-related emissions and captures domestic fuel consumption, regardless of the place of refuelling. Air freight is excluded from the analysis due to its relatively minor share of total freight volume. Due to the definitional limitation to domestic FEC, the indicator reflects the effects of increasing international economic integration of Germany\u2019s economy only to a limited extent.<br><br>In 2023, transport of goods accounted for 26.1%<sup>1</sup> of total transport-related final energy consumption. For the first time, FEC in this sector fell below 2015&nbsp;levels&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;representing a 3.4% decline compared to the base year. The politically defined goal is to reduce FEC in transport of goods by 15% to 20% between 2015&nbsp;and 2030. If recent trends continue, this target is likely to be met.<br><br>Transport of goods performance measures the quantity of goods transported over a given distance, based on data from the TREMOD database. Between 2015&nbsp;and 2021, the number of tonne-kilometres travelled rose by 8.4%, interrupted only by a brief decline in 2020. However, by 2023, transport performance had decreased again, remaining only 2.6% above the 2015&nbsp;level.<br><br>In addition to absolute energy consumption, FEC is also considered in relation to freight transport performance to provide insight into energy efficiency. In 2023, FEC per tonne-kilometre stood at 94.1% of the 2015&nbsp;value&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;the lowest level in eight years. FEC has declined across all modes of freight transport compared to 2015. The most significant reduction was recorded in inland waterways, with a decrease of 26.2%. In contrast, energy consumption in road freight transport dropped by only 2.8%, and by 1.1% in rail transport.<br><br><small><sup>1</sup> The sum of the shares of freight transport (indicator 11.2.a) and passenger transport (indicator <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/11-2-b/\">11.2.b</a>) in total final energy consumption in transport does not add up to 100%.
