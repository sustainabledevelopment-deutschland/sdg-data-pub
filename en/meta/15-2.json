Excessive deposition of nitrogen compounds from the air into terrestrial ecosystems can lead to nutrient imbalances. This affects, among other things, species composition: plant species that prefer nitrogen-poor sites are displaced by nitrogen-loving species. Furthermore, altered nutrient availability increases the susceptibility of many plants to frost, drought, or pests. The consequences of elevated nitrogen deposition often manifest only with a temporal delay. Similarly, positive effects of reduced deposition frequently only become apparent after several years.<br><br>Emissions of ammonia and nitrogen oxides, which are recorded in indicator <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/3-2-a/\">3.2.a</a> <i>Emissions of Air Pollutants</i>, have a direct impact on the eutrophication of ecosystems. Ecosystems included in the indicator\u2019s calculation comprise in particular forests, semi-natural grasslands, bogs, marshes, and heaths. Ecosystem-specific critical loads are used to assess nitrogen deposition. When these limits are adhered to, the structure, function, and species communities of an ecosystem are preserved according to current scientific understanding. Approximately eleven million hectares are assessed in this manner, representing nearly one third of Germany\u2019s total area.<br><br>In 2019, nitrogen deposition exceeded the critical loads on 69% of the assessed sensitive ecosystems in Germany. Particularly high exceedances occur in parts of northern Germany, where intensive agriculture releases large amounts of reactive nitrogen compounds. Between 2000&nbsp;and 2015, the proportion of affected areas was reduced by 15&nbsp;percentage points. Since then, no further reduction in the share of impacted areas has been observed.<br><br>The calculation of the indicator is performed by the German Environment Agency (UBA) and is based on two datasets: The first is the Critical Load dataset provided by the UBA within the framework of international reporting to the Geneva Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP). This is based, among other data, on the soil overview map of Germany, the map of average annual leachate rates, land use distribution, and climate data. The second dataset comprises a time series of nitrogen deposition in Germany, calculated within the framework of the PINETI IV project (Pollutant INput and EcosysTem Impact).</p>","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the German Environment Agency', 'En')\">German Environment Agency</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the German Environment Agency', 'En')\">German Environment Agency</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the German Environment Agency', 'En')\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/uba.png\" alt=\"German Environment Agency\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationGerman Environment Agency\" style=\"height:60px;
