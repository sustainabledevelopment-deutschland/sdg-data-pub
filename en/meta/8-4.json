Between 1991&nbsp;and 2021, price-adjusted <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr> per head of population increased by a total of 38.8&nbsp;%. In consequence of the <abbr title=\"Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2\" tabindex=\"0\">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;pandemic, the price adjusted <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr> per head of population decreased in 2020&nbsp;by 3.8&nbsp;%. Only in 2009, price adjusted per capita <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr> fell by 5.4&nbsp;% as a result of the global financial and economic crisis and, thus, decreased to a larger extent. The absent definition for appropriate and continuous economic growth causes the consideration of the average annual change for the preceding five years. These was 0.7&nbsp;%. Therefore, the indicator developed in a positive direction long-term.<br><br>Considering the results of the German L\u00e4nder, Mecklenburg Western Pomerania had the lowest (26,500&nbsp;euros) and Hamburg had the highest (59,700&nbsp;euros) real <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr> per capita.<br><br><abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr> expresses the value of total economic output produced within the country in a reference period. It focuses primarily on market goods and services and public goods and services. The value of <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr> is determined quarterly and annually by the Federal Statistical Office and the statistical offices of the L\u00e4nder on the basis of internationally harmonised rules and standards, such as the European System of National and Regional Accounts (<abbr title=\"European System of National and Regional Accounts\" tabindex=\"0\">ESA</abbr>).<br><br><abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr> is a key variable in the national accounts. The national accounts are the consolidation of several accounts that portray the economic activity of a given period. The results are recorded in the form of a closed sequence of accounts and presented in tables. The national accounts calculations were last reviewed and revised in 2019&nbsp;as part of their periodic major revision, and the reference year was changed to 2015. This resulted in new rates of change for real gross domestic product as a whole. The overall economic picture, however, has remained largely unchanged.<br><br><abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr> is not designed to portray all of the social aspects that can be included in a measurement of overall well-being. If these variables are to be measured too, Additional indicators are needed that are specifically designed for these purposes. This includes <abbr title=\"for example (exempli gratia)\" tabindex=\"0\">e.g.</abbr> environmental economic accounts that portray the interactions between the economy and the environment and indicators showing, for example, the volume of unpaid work in households. Furthermore, the distribution of income and assets among different population groups is not shown by <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr> either.<br><br>Stock changes are not reflected in <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr>, except in the case of capital stock resulting from the calculation of investments and depreciation. Key economic variables like quantities and qualities of human capital, such as education and health, of social capital, such as security and integration, and of natural capital, such as resources and ecosystems, are not factored into <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr>. It is therefore impossible to conclude whether <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr> and its growth have served to preserve capital in the fullest sense. This means that <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr> cannot be used to gauge the sustainability of economic growth.<br><br>The basis for the calculation of per capita <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr> comprise the average population figures interpolated and extrapolated by the Federal Statistical Office from the 2011&nbsp;census data.","embedded_feature_html":"<p>Additional data series for the indicator can be found(<a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/public/AddInfos/en/8_4.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" >here</a>.</p><br><small>Note: You can display the PDF document directly in your browser or download the PDF document and open it with a PDF reader of your choice.
