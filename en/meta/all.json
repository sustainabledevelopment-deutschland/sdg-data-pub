The data record fuel consumption within Germany irrespective of where refuelling takes place. \u201cFinal energy\u201d refers to that part of the total energy used that is directly consumed in transport. It does not cover the conversion losses that arise during the production of fuels or any pipeline losses that may occur.<br><br><abbr title=\"Transport Emission Model\" tabindex=\"0\">TREMOD</abbr> also supplies the goods transport volumes which are used to calculate the specific energy consumption of this sector. Air freight transport is not included, as it accounts for negligibly small volumes.<br><br>By definition, the indicator for final energy consumption in goods transport refers to consumption within Germany. It gives only an inadequate reflection of the German economy\u2019s increasingly complex international ties in a globalised world.<br><br>The energy-consumption data presented here is supplemented by energy efficiency, or energy consumed per tonne-kilometre. The number of tonne-kilometres provides information about the extent to which transport intensity or the distance per transported tonne changes.<br><br>Contrary to the Federal Government\u2019s target, final energy consumption for the carriage of goods was 1.8&nbsp;% higher in 2020&nbsp;compared with 2005. Goods thereby accounted for 28.7&nbsp;%<sup>1</sup> of total final energy consumption in the transport sector. The sharp increase can be attributed primarily to freight transport by road. Final energy consumption in road goods transport increased by 3.8&nbsp;% during this period, while consumption for rail and inland shipping was significantly reduced (\u2012&nbsp;17.9&nbsp;% and&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;32.7&nbsp;% respectively).<br><br>During the same period, goods transport volumes increased by 15.9&nbsp;%. In conjunction with comparable energy consumption in 2005&nbsp;and 2020, this means a significant increase in efficiency of 12.2&nbsp;% during that time.<br><br>During the economic crisis of 2009, price-adjusted gross value added in the manufacturing industry suffered a particularly sharp decline of just under 20&nbsp;%. This heavy loss particularly affected the transport sector, which reacts directly to increases and falls in the production of goods. The resultant decrease in the utilisation of transport capacity explains why average energy consumption per tonne-kilometre rose slightly despite the sharp fall in overall energy consumption in absolute terms during the crisis years.<br><br>After the crisis, the transportation industry has recovered fastly and the transportation volume already increased in 2010&nbsp;above the value in 2005&nbsp;by 45&nbsp;billion tonne-kilometres. The pre-crisis level from 2008&nbsp;was exceeded in 2015. The development continued and increased by 12&nbsp;% until 2019&nbsp;compared to the value in 2010. Simultaneously, the energy consumption increased only slightly by 4.3&nbsp;%, which caused an increase in efficiency by 6.9&nbsp;% in this period. However, the development reversed during the first year of pandemic. In 2020, energy consumption and transportation volume reduced by 3.2&nbsp;% and 4.3&nbsp;%, respectively, compared to pre-pandemic level in 2019, whereby the pandemic affected goods transport not as severe as passenger transport (see indicator 11.2.b). Further, the comparably small decrease in energy consumption caused a slight deterioration in efficiency by 1.2&nbsp;%.<br><br>This is why the latest trend of the indicator presents a beneficial development, although the consumption per tonne-kilometre also increased.<br><br><small><sup>1</sup>The sum of shares of goods transport (indicator 11.2.a) and passenger transport (indicator 11.2.b) in proportion to total final energy consumption in transport do not add up to 100&nbsp;%. This discrepancy is caused by different definitions of energy consumption in passenger and goods transport (domestic consumption; source: <abbr title=\"Transport Emission Model\" tabindex=\"0\">TREMOD</abbr>) and total final energy consumption in traffic (domestic sales; source: AG Energiebilanzen).</small>","embedded_feature_html":"<p>Additional data series for the indicator can be found <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/AddInfos/en/11_2_a.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" >here</a>.</p><br><small>Note: You can display the PDF document directly in your browser or download the PDF document and open it with a PDF reader of your choice.

The <abbr title=\"Corruption Perception Index\" tabindex=\"0\">CPI</abbr> is a composite indicator that is based on various expert and corporate surveys regarding the perception of corruption in the public sector.

In this case, the type of the imported goods is also recorded in detail in addition to their country of origin, their value and weight. The service sector is excluded from foreign trade statistics.<br><br>The various countries are classified as <abbr title=\"Least developed countries\" tabindex=\"0\">LDCs</abbr> based on the list of recipients of official development assistance kept by the Development Assistance Committee (<abbr title=\"Development Assistance Committee\" tabindex=\"0\">DAC</abbr>) of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (<abbr title=\"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\" tabindex=\"0\">OECD</abbr>). The classifications valid in the respective year according to the <abbr title=\"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\" tabindex=\"0\">OECD</abbr>-DAC are used for this indicator. If the status of a country changes, this will impact the indicator even if the value of imports from this country remains unchanged.<br><br>Due to reimports, duplicate counting in the numerator and denominator of the indicator cannot be excluded. The fact that the imports from <abbr title=\"Least developed countries\" tabindex=\"0\">LDCs</abbr> are viewed in relation to all German imports must also be taken into account. This means that the value of the indicator depends not only on the absolute quantity of imports from <abbr title=\"Least developed countries\" tabindex=\"0\">LDCs</abbr>, but also on the value of all imports. Alongside Germany\u2019s total imports from <abbr title=\"Least developed countries\" tabindex=\"0\">LDCs</abbr>, the indicator also shows what share is made up of processed products. The intention here is to address the question, at least to some extent, as to whether Germany mainly uses <abbr title=\"Least developed countries\" tabindex=\"0\">LDCs</abbr> as sources of basic materials for industrially produced goods or whether the <abbr title=\"Least developed countries\" tabindex=\"0\">LDCs</abbr> themselves have a stake in the manufacturing process and the associated value creation. These include all goods not classified as raw materials in the classification according to product groups of the food and industrial economy (<abbr title=\"Classification of goods in the food and industrial economy in Foreign Trade Statistics\" tabindex=\"0\">EGW</abbr>). The term thus does not encompass products extracted from nature and not or hardly processed, such as petroleum, ores, timber in the rough or vegetable textile fibres. Conversely, cereals, vegetables, live animals, meat and milk are classified as processed products.<br><br>Imports from <abbr title=\"Least developed countries\" tabindex=\"0\">LDCs</abbr> as a proportion of all imports to Germany was 1.03&nbsp;% or 12.4&nbsp;billion euros in 2021&nbsp;(provisional results). This is an increase of more than 44.5&nbsp;% compared with 2014, when the share was just 0.71&nbsp;%. The share of imports of processed products from <abbr title=\"Least developed countries\" tabindex=\"0\">LDCs</abbr> increased even more sharply between 2014&nbsp;and 2021&nbsp;(+&nbsp;38.7&nbsp;%). In 2021, It has reached 0.91&nbsp;% of total imports to Germany (2014: 0.66&nbsp;%), which equates to a value of around 11.0&nbsp;billion euros. Despite the steady increase from 2014&nbsp;on, if the development of the last five years continues, it can be assumed that the target will be missed.<br><br>Closer analysis of the various countries of origin reveals that the largest amount of Germany\u2019s imports from <abbr title=\"Least developed countries\" tabindex=\"0\">LDCs</abbr> in 2021&nbsp;came from Bangladesh (57.3&nbsp;%) or Cambodia (12.6&nbsp;%). If one looks not only at the <abbr title=\"Least developed countries\" tabindex=\"0\">LDCs</abbr> but at all developing and emerging countries, their share of total imports to Germany in 2021&nbsp;was 23.7&nbsp;%, and processed products from those countries accounted for 22.1&nbsp;%. China plays the most important role among all developing and emerging countries. Of all German imports in 2021, 1,203.2&nbsp;billion euros or 11.8&nbsp;% came from China alone, with processed goods making up 99.6&nbsp;%. Netherlands (8.8&nbsp;%) and the United States (6.0&nbsp;%) are the second and third most important trading partners concerning imports, respectively.","embedded_feature_html":"<p>Additional data series for the indicator can be found <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/AddInfos/en/17_3.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" >here</a>.</p><br><small>Note: You can display the PDF document directly in your browser or download the PDF document and open it with a PDF reader of your choice.

Agricultural area is recorded by primary statistical methods in a structural survey. Since not every year is covered in the survey, data for interim years are calculated by an estimation procedure. The reference value for the proportional computation is the amount of utilised agricultural area determined annually as part of the land use survey. The reporting date is 01&nbsp;March of the respective year. The utilised agricultural area includes all areas and sub-areas used for agricultural or horticultural purposes. Building and farmyard areas of agricultural holdings are therefore not included in the reference value.<br><br>The data collected by the <abbr title=\"Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture\" tabindex=\"0\">BMEL</abbr> include details of the amount of organically farmed land reported annually by the organic regulatory authorities of the L\u00e4nder. The reporting date is 31&nbsp;December of a year. All reports for a current year are accumulated no later than the reporting date. The data from the <abbr title=\"Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture\" tabindex=\"0\">BMEL</abbr> contain slightly higher values. Amongst others, this is due to the fact that areas without a cut-off threshold are related to all areas with a cut-off threshold. This means that very small areas are also included in the numerator when calculating the proportion, whereas only areas above a certain minimum size are taken into account in the denominator.<br><br>According to data from the Federal Statistical Office, the share of organically farmed land increased from 2.9&nbsp;% to 9.5&nbsp;% between 1999&nbsp;and 2021. As a result, in 2021&nbsp;this amounted to an area of 1.61&nbsp;million hectares. The data from the <abbr title=\"Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture\" tabindex=\"0\">BMEL</abbr> indicate a slightly higher share of organically farmed land in total agricultural land due to the methodology employed. Consequently, the value for 2021&nbsp;was 10.9&nbsp;% or 1.80&nbsp;million hectares.<br><br>Based on data from the Federal Statistical Office, the share of organically farmed agricultural land will be 14.9&nbsp;% in 2030&nbsp;if the trend continues at the level recorded in the preceding five reporting years. Hence, neither the target of reaching 30&nbsp;% nor the outdated 20&nbsp;% target of organically farmed agricultural land by 2030&nbsp;would be met. <br><br>Germany\u2019s organically farmed land was used as follows in 2021: 50.6&nbsp;% as permanent pasture, 47.8&nbsp;% for arable land and 1.6&nbsp;% for other land. In contrast, the main focus of agriculture as a whole was on arable land (70.3&nbsp;%), while the share of permanent pasture was 28.5&nbsp;% and other land accounted for 1.2&nbsp;% of the total utilised agricultural area. According to the results of the 2020&nbsp;farm structure survey, Saarland held the largest share of organically farmed land among all L\u00e4nder (around 18.0&nbsp;%), followed by Hessen (15.0&nbsp;%) and Brandenburg (13.3&nbsp;%). The conversion to organic farming is promoted to varying degrees by the individual L\u00e4nder.<br><br>According to <abbr title=\"European Statistical Office\" tabindex=\"0\">Eurostat</abbr> statistics, a total area of 14.7&nbsp;million hectares was organically farmed in the states of the <abbr title=\"European Union consisting of 27&nbsp;member states (without United Kingdom)\" tabindex=\"0\">EU-27</abbr>&nbsp;in 2020.

This is equivalent to a turnover of 26.5&nbsp;billion euros in 2019. The highest value was measured in 2016&nbsp;at 8.6&nbsp;%. The indicator value sank in 2017&nbsp;and 2018&nbsp;relative to the previous year, whereby the share slightly increased in 2019. Basically, the indicator follows the trend of the car market. The market share of A +&nbsp;cars decreased from 14&nbsp;% (2016) to 9.6&nbsp;% (2018) and increased again in 2019&nbsp;(10.0&nbsp;%). The trend of the indicator developed in the right direction but unless the trend is reversed and the market share is considerably increased, Germany will fall short of the 2030&nbsp;target.<br><br>The data used for this indicator comes from the German Environment Agency (<abbr title=\"Federal Environment Agency\" tabindex=\"0\">UBA</abbr>). The <abbr title=\"Federal Environment Agency\" tabindex=\"0\">UBA</abbr> utilizes information from various sources for the calculation of the indicator, for example from the consumer research institute. The indicator is made up of the market share of products which either bear the highest category of <abbr title=\"European Union\" tabindex=\"0\">EU</abbr> energy label within their class or are certified by the <abbr title=\"European Union\" tabindex=\"0\">EU</abbr> Ecolabel, the Euro-leaf organic logo or the German Blue Angel. The <abbr title=\"European Union\" tabindex=\"0\">EU</abbr> energy label primarily addresses energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, while the other three ecolabels also take into account other threats to the environment such as pesticide use and harmful wastewater. The indicator is intended to show whether environmentally friendly product variants are replacing conventional ones in the market. Only a selection of product groups is examined, in part because limited data are available on turnover for products bearing sustainability labels. This also makes it possible to avoid certain products being counted more than once.<br><br>The indicator encompasses consumption in the fields of home life, mobility and nutrition. Household appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines, televisions and vacuum cleaners are assessed, as are light bulbs, foodstuffs, sanitary paper, detergents and cars. Since the markets for the individual product groups are of different sizes, the market shares are weighted according to the total turnover of the market in question. This is intended to prevent the indicator being distorted by products which have high shares of small niche markets. Furthermore, this means expenditure on environmentally friendly products can be considered in relation to the total expenditure of private households.<br><br>It is not possible to weight the market shares according to the market relevance of the respective product groups because the environmental labels address different categories (energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, material demand) that cannot be balanced against one another. This also makes it impossible to set out the environmental footprint, or comprehensive evaluation taking in several environmental categories, of each product group. Moreover, the indicator only covers goods newly brought into circulation in relation to the market as a whole. It thereby gives no indication as to whether the enhanced efficiency of an appliance results in a change in consumer behaviour and perhaps to an increase in consumption&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;the rebound effect. It also describes the market share on the basis of turnover. Given the price differences between products with and without the relevant ecolabels, this means no conclusions can be drawn about their numbers. It follows that a change in the indicator value might have been caused by price alterations within a product group.","embedded_feature_html":"<p>Additional data series for the indicator can be found <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/AddInfos/en/12_1_a.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" >here</a>.</p><br><small>Note: You can display the PDF document directly in your browser or download the PDF document and open it with a PDF reader of your choice.

Emissions of ammonia and nitrogen oxides are depicted as part of indicator 3.2.a on emissions of air pollutants, and developments in that area directly affect the eutrophication of ecosystems. The sensitive ecosystems covered in the calculations for this indicator are forests, natural grassland, wetlands, marshes and heathland.<br><br>Excessive inputs of nitrogen compounds from the air into land ecosystems can result in nutrient imbalances. The alterations in nutrient availability can lead, for example, to changes in the species composition of an ecosystem, with organisms which prefer nitrogen-poor locations being displaced by nitrogen-loving species. Meanwhile, many plants can be rendered vulnerable to frost, drought and pests by changes in nutrient availability. The effects of excessive nitrogen inputs often take several years to manifest themselves. Likewise, the positive effects of reduced inputs will become apparent only after an extended period.<br><br>For the purposes of evaluating nitrogen inputs, ecosystem-specific critical loads are determined which represent the saturation points below which, based on the latest knowledge available, the structures, functions and biological communities of an ecosystem remain protected. In total, around 11&nbsp;million hectares, almost one third of the entire area of Germany, are assessed in this way.<br><br>In 2019, the critical loads for harmful nitrogen inputs were exceeded on 69&nbsp;% of the area of all the sensitive ecosystems assessed in Germany. Excesses were particularly high in parts of northern Germany, where agricultural activity releases large quantities of reactive nitrogen compounds.<br><br>Between 2000&nbsp;and 2015, the proportion of areas in which critical loads for nitrogen were exceeded was reduced by 15&nbsp;percentage points.

It is calculated by dividing the body weight in kilograms by the square of an individual\u2019s height in metres. This calculation does not take age-specific and gender-specific differences into account. Nor does it indicate the individual body mass composition. However, obesity and excess weight among children and adolescents are defined by taking account also of age and gender. In order to determine if people suffer from obesity or excess weight, the individual <abbr title=\"Body Mass Index\" tabindex=\"0\">BMI</abbr> value is compared with a defined comparison group (reference population). The percentile reference values according to Kromeyer-Hauschild as recommended by the \u201cArbeitsgemeinschaft Adipositas im Kinder- und Jugendalter\u201d are used as a comparative benchmark. According to these values, children and adolescents are considered to be overweight if their <abbr title=\"Body Mass Index\" tabindex=\"0\">BMI</abbr> value is above the 90th age- and gender-specific percentile of the reference population (> <abbr title=\"90th percentile\" tabindex=\"0\">P90</abbr>). This means that they fall within the range of those 10&nbsp;% of the reference group with the highest <abbr title=\"Body Mass Index\" tabindex=\"0\">BMI</abbr> values. A <abbr title=\"Body Mass Index\" tabindex=\"0\">BMI</abbr> value above the 97th percentile of the reference population (that is, as high as the 3&nbsp;% of adolescents with the highest <abbr title=\"Body Mass Index\" tabindex=\"0\">BMI</abbr> values) is classified as obesity (> <abbr title=\"97th percentile\" tabindex=\"0\">P97</abbr>). For example, girls and boys aged three with a <abbr title=\"Body Mass Index\" tabindex=\"0\">BMI</abbr> of 18.8&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Kilogram per square meter\" tabindex=\"0\">kg/m\u00b2</abbr> are considered to be obese. These reference values are based on details of body size and weight that were recorded between 1985&nbsp;and 1998&nbsp;in various regions of Germany, using different methods.<br><br>The data for the indicator is gathered by the Robert Koch Institute. The German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;referred to as the <abbr title=\"Study on the health of children and adolescents in Germany\" tabindex=\"0\">KiGGS</abbr> baseline study) for the period 2003&nbsp;to 2006&nbsp;delivered the first nationwide representative results.

In order to allow the data to be compared in a suitable way, the results were age standardised to the reference date 31&nbsp;December 2015&nbsp;of the intercensal population update.<br><br>For the time period 2014&nbsp;to 2017, 3.9&nbsp;% of the 3&nbsp;to 10-year-olds and 8.0&nbsp;% of the 11&nbsp;to 17-year-olds were classified as obese. While there were no differences between the sexes in the 3&nbsp;to 10&nbsp;years age group, the rates for the 11&nbsp;to 17-year-olds were 7.2&nbsp;% for girls and 8.7&nbsp;% for boys. In the period from 2003&nbsp;to 2006, the proportion of 3&nbsp;to 10-year-olds with obesity was about 5.2&nbsp;%; among the 11&nbsp;to 17-year olds, it was about 8.3&nbsp;%. Again, girls and boys in the age from 3&nbsp;to 10&nbsp;years were equally affected. The figure for the 11&nbsp;to 17-year-olds broke down into 8.2&nbsp;% of the girls and 8.4&nbsp;% of the boys. The obesity rate has therefore fallen more sharply among 3&nbsp;to 10-year-olds than in the 11&nbsp;to 17&nbsp;age group. While it fell by 1.0&nbsp;percentage points among girls aged 11&nbsp;to 17, it showed a slight increase of 0.3&nbsp;percentage points among boys in that age group.<br><br>The proportion of adolescents suffering from excess weight including obesity (> <abbr title=\"90th percentile\" tabindex=\"0\">P90</abbr>) did not change much compared with the period 2003&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;2006&nbsp;(decrease by 0.6&nbsp;percentage points to 12.3&nbsp;% for 3&nbsp;to 10-year olds, increase by 0.6&nbsp;percentage points to 18.7&nbsp;% for 11&nbsp;to 17-year-olds).<br><br>Important factors in the development of overweight are dietary and exercise behaviour, which differ&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;when looking at the results&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;in terms of socioeconomic status (<abbr title=\"Socioeconomic status\" tabindex=\"0\">SES</abbr>). The results from <abbr title=\"Study on the health of children and adolescents in Germany\" tabindex=\"0\">KiGGS</abbr> Wave 2&nbsp;confirm that 3&nbsp;to 17-year-old children and adolescents with a low socioeconomic status eat unhealthy more often than their peers from socially better-off families and exercise less frequently.

Changes in the number of inhabitants and changes in the extent of settlement and transport area both affect figures for the density of settlements.<br><br>Settlement density varies considerably between rural and non-rural areas, with the figures for 2020&nbsp;showing an average of 3,337&nbsp;people per square kilometre of settlement and transport area in non-rural districts but around 1,197&nbsp;in rural districts. Residential building land in towns and cities is frequently much more densely developed, and with more multiple-floor buildings, than in rural regions, where more scattered development incorporating larger unsealed areas such as domestic gardens is prevalent.<br><br>From 2000&nbsp;to 2009, there was a steady decline in settlement density in both rural and nonrural regions. The reduction in absolute terms is slightly smaller in non-rural areas than in rural regions. In relative terms, given the distinctly lower settlement density in rural areas, the reduction was considerably greater there, at 11&nbsp;%, than the 4&nbsp;% reduction observed in non-rural areas. Settlement density in non-rural regions been rising again since 2011. This shows that settlement and transport area in relatively urban areas is being used more efficiently than in previous years.<br><br>Looking at the trends in population numbers and settlement and transport area separately reveals marked differences between rural and non-rural regions. Between 2000&nbsp;and 2020, the amount of settlement and transport area in both rural and non-rural regions increased, though to differing extents&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;by 15.9&nbsp;% and 8.8&nbsp;% respectively. After rising slightly at the beginning of the century, the rural population then shrank by approximately 2.6&nbsp;% until 2012&nbsp;before increasing again by 2.1&nbsp;% by 2020. In contrast, the population in non-rural regions grew by 1.7&nbsp;% between 2000&nbsp;and 2010&nbsp;and again, by 5.6&nbsp;%, between 2011&nbsp;and 2020. The effects that the development of additional settlement and transport area had on the indicator were therefore amplified in rural regions by the declining population numbers there.<br><br>The data sources for this indicator are the population figures and the area survey by type of actual use compiled by the Federal Statistical Office. In the population numbers, the 2011&nbsp;census caused a jump in the time series. Some areas of land have moreover been reclassified in the official land register maintained by the L\u00e4nder in recent years, without any actual change in the way they are used. Additionally, the switch from the old to the new land-use classification system was completed in 2016, which affected the official land-use statistics such that the data for 2016&nbsp;are not directly comparable to those for previous years. So that comparisons can nevertheless be drawn, the relevant values were extrapolated on the basis of the 2011&nbsp;census and the 2016&nbsp;reform of the land-use survey.<br><br>The distinction between rural and non-rural is based on a classification used by the Th\u00fcnen Institute. The institute ascribes a degree of rurality to districts and district-free cities on the basis of geographical characteristics such as settlement density, share of farmland and woodland, and the accessibility of urban centres. The classification is thus applied to whole districts rather than to smaller entities like towns or villages. In 2020, 43&nbsp;% and 57&nbsp;% of the population lived in non-rural and rural areas by this definition, respectively.","embedded_feature_html":"<p>Additional data series for the indicator can be found <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/AddInfos/en/11_1_c.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" >here</a>.</p><br><small>Note: You can display the PDF document directly in your browser or download the PDF document and open it with a PDF reader of your choice.

Greenhouse gases absorb and emit infrared radiation from the earth in different wave ranges with varying intensity, and have different residence time in the atmosphere. Hence, the effects of greenhouse gases are subject to their concentration in the atmosphere and contribute to a variable extent to the greenhouse effect. To summarise the various greenhouse gases into a single index, they are each expressed in \u201cCO\u2082 equivalents\u201d, which means that they are converted into the quantity of <abbr title=\"Carbon dioxide\" tabindex=\"0\">CO\u2082</abbr> that would have a comparable impact on global warming. Because of cumulation, however, the development of the individual greenhouse gases cannot be determined. A negative development of one greenhouse gas can for instance be concealed by a positive development of another greenhouse gas.<br><br>The data is provided annually by the German Environment Agency as part of the reporting required under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (<abbr title=\"United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\" tabindex=\"0\">UNFCCC</abbr>), the Paris Agreement<sup>1</sup> and the Federal Climate Change Act.

The largest emitters of greenhouse gases and air pollutants within Germany were therefore identified, and the quantity of their emissions under certain circumstances was investigated. A specific emissions factor derived from those findings was then multiplied by the emitter\u2019s activity data to arrive at the overall quantity of emissions.<br><br>It should be noted that, in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol, the indicator does not show carbon dioxide emissions arising from land use, land-use change and forestry. Maritime shipping and international aviation are also excluded from the calculation.<br><br>Looking at developments between 2015&nbsp;and 2021, it is clear that the indicator has not progressed in a stable manner. In 2015&nbsp;and 2016, greenhouse-gas emissions rose slightly by 0.3&nbsp;percentage points. Since 2017, however, they have sunk noticeably, by 1.3&nbsp;percentage points in 2017, 2.8&nbsp;percentage points in 2018, 4.1&nbsp;percentage points in 2019&nbsp;and 5.7&nbsp;percentage points in 2020. The targeted reduction of 40&nbsp;% by 2020&nbsp;in comparison to 2008&nbsp;was achieved at 41.3&nbsp;%. Particularly, the changes can be attributed to the consequences from the <abbr title=\"Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2\" tabindex=\"0\">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;pandemic due to the decline in traffic and industrial output. However, greenhouse gas emissions increased by 2.6&nbsp;% in 2021. According to provisional emission data by the Federal Climate Change Act on long-term development, emissions reduced by 38.7&nbsp;% in 2021&nbsp;compared to 1990. If the development continues according to the preceding five years, the goal to reduce emissions by 65&nbsp;% by 2030&nbsp;compared to 1990&nbsp;will be missed. Further, the former goal of the Federal Government would also be missed in the case of continuation of the trend, that is, a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 55&nbsp;% by 2030. <br><br>By far the greatest share of total greenhouse-gases in 2021&nbsp;was carbon dioxide, at 88.6&nbsp;%, compared with 84.7&nbsp;% in 1990.

For 3&nbsp;to 5-year-olds (4.2.b), the proportion is to increase to at least 70&nbsp;% by 2030. An increase in the proportion of children attending all-day care is desirable because the availability of childcare options that meet the needs of today\u2019s families improve the compatibility of family life and work. They also make an important contribution to equal opportunities, gender equality and integration.","data_state":"The data published in the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/assets/Publikationen/Indikatorenberichte/2022.pdf\">indicator report 2022</a> is as of 31 October 2022.

Contractually agreed childcare provision of seven hours and less, which can also improve the compatibility of work and family life, and other types of care, <abbr title=\"for example (exempli gratia)\" tabindex=\"0\">e.g.</abbr> day care in private homes, are not included. Furthermore, information on childcare services aimed at children aged 6&nbsp;years and older is also relevant to this topic. Such supplementary information is included, for example, in the data of the Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the L\u00e4nder in the Federal Republic of Germany (see the last paragraph).<br><br>The information of the indicator is provided by the annual statistics on children cared for and persons employed in day care centres, which is compiled by the Federal Statistical Office. In 2022, all-day care in day care centres was arranged for 47.0&nbsp;% of the 3&nbsp;to 5-year-old children (kindergarten age). For children under 3&nbsp;years of age (nursery age) this figure was 16.8&nbsp;%. As a result, the share of children in all-day care below the age of 3&nbsp;almost tripled and have more than doubled for the 3&nbsp;to 5-year-olds since 2006. However, the increase for both indicators is significantly reducing since 2014&nbsp;and, furthermore, the share of children for both age groups in all-day care is diminishing since 2020.<br><br>The total number of children below the age of six receiving all-day care in day care centres in 2022&nbsp;was 1.61&nbsp;million. Another 67,416&nbsp;children below six years of age were receiving publicly subsidised childminder care; like those five-year-old children who are already at school, they are not covered by the indicator. In addition, in 2022&nbsp;some 1.46&nbsp;million children were receiving part-time care of seven hours or less.<br><br>Both age groups reported stagnating or declining total number of children in population until 2014, but the increased migration of refugees significantly increased the number of children since 2015. However, the growing number of refugees had no effect on the number of children in all-day care from 2015&nbsp;until the pandemic and, hence, the growth of the indicators was weakened.<br><br>In 2020, more than a quarter of the children under six years cared for in day care centres or by publicly supported childminding services had a migrant background, meaning that at least one of the parents was of foreign origin. 51&nbsp;% of these children were in day care, compared with 71&nbsp;% of the children without a migrant background.<br><br>With regard to the availability of all-day care provided by facilities, there is a clear gap between the L\u00e4nder in the east and the L\u00e4nder in the west of Germany. The highest percentages of 0&nbsp;to 2-year-olds in all-day care are recorded in the eastern L\u00e4nder and in Berlin. The values range from 50.7&nbsp;% in Thuringia to 9.5&nbsp;% in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. For 3&nbsp;to 5-year-olds, the percentage was also highest in Thuringia at 91.6&nbsp;% and lowest in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg at 24.1&nbsp;% (each 2022).<br><br>When it comes to opportunities of care for pupils, pre and after-school care programmes and all-day schools also play a significant role. In 2021, 18,967&nbsp;children between 5&nbsp;and 13&nbsp;years of age were looked after on an all-day basis in care programmes and 486,408&nbsp;children part-time (lessons are not regarded as childcare). The percentage of pupils attending all-day schools of all pupils in schools of general education was 47.2&nbsp;% in the 2020/2021&nbsp;school year. However, this figure includes pupils from all school types and hence includes also pupils who are older than 13&nbsp;years. In primary schools, 46.5&nbsp;% of children received all-day care in that school year. In comparison to 2006, the number of all-day school pupils has increased considerably in 2021, from almost 1.5&nbsp;million to 3.4&nbsp;million (in all schools of general education) and from 0.4&nbsp;million to 1.3&nbsp;million in the primary schools.","embedded_feature_html":"<p>Additional data series for the indicator can be found <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/AddInfos/en/4_2_ab.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" >here</a>.</p><br><small>Note: You can display the PDF document directly in your browser or download the PDF document and open it with a PDF reader of your choice.

Nitrogen removal results from plant and animal market products. Nitrogen surplus in its gaseous state can leak to the atmosphere or accumulate in soil or groundwater, enabling nitrogen input to rivers or other ecosystems. Hence, the nitrogen surplus from farming has a direct impact on the development of the indicators 6.1.b \u201cNitrate in groundwater\u201c, 14.1.a \u201cNitrogen inputs via the inflows into the North and Baltic Seas\u201c and 15.2&nbsp;\u201cEutrophication of ecosystems\u201c. Nitrogen input from farming into the atmosphere has an impact on indicator 3.2.a \u201cEmissions of air pollutants\u201c through formation of nitrogen dioxide and ammonia.<br><br>The indicator is calculated by the Institute for Crop and Soil Science at the Julius K\u00fchn Institute and the Institute of Landscape Ecology and Resources Management at the University of Gie\u00dfen. In 2020, fertilisers were the most important component of nitrogen input in the overall balance, accounting for 51.1&nbsp;% (86&nbsp;kilograms of nitrogen per hectare). Feedstuff contributed 36.9&nbsp;% (62&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Kilogram per hectare\" tabindex=\"0\">kg/ha</abbr>), the biological nitrogen fixation 8.2&nbsp;% (14&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Kilogram per hectare\" tabindex=\"0\">kg/ha</abbr>) and the non-agricultural emissions 1.9&nbsp;% (3&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Kilogram per hectare\" tabindex=\"0\">kg/ha</abbr>) to nitrogen input.<br><br>The relevant time series for the indicator is based on the moving five-year average of the total balances of the relevant year as well as the two preceding and subsequent years. Thereby, yearly meteorological and market fluctuations, which cannot be influenced by farms, are balanced. The indicator does not provide an interpretation regarding the regional distribution of nitrogen surpluses.<br><br>During the period from 1992&nbsp;to 2018, the moving five-year average of nitrogen balance decreased by 25.4&nbsp;% (from 116.6&nbsp;to 87.0&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Kilogram\" tabindex=\"0\">kg</abbr> per hectare and year). The decline of nitrogen surplus until 2010&nbsp;resulted from diminished use of fertilisers and diminishing numbers of livestock in the new L\u00e4nder.<br><br>Until 2015, nitrogen surplus stagnated. The marginal decline of the indicator in the remaining course of the time series is based on a minor reduction in mineral fertiliser use and improved harvest yields resulting from technical advances in plant production and breeding (more efficient nitrogen fertilisation, variety spectrum) combined with the simultaneous expansion in the cultivation of high-yield crop types (maize, wheat) as well as improved feed conversion by livestock.<br><br>Since 2015, the nitrogen surplus decreased and the recent reduction was 4.9&nbsp;% in 2018. It is uncertain, to what extent extreme agroclimatic conditions (drought from 2018&nbsp;until 2020) and the amended fertiliser regulation released in 2017&nbsp;contributed to this positive trend.

Gross electricity consumption is the sum of all generated and imported electricity minus the amount of exported electricity. It therefore comprises the domestic electricity generation, the balance of exchanges across national borders, the self-consumption of power plants as well as transmission losses. The following are considered to be renewable energy sources: wind energy, hydropower, solar radiation energy, geothermal energy and biomass including biogas, biomethane, landfill gas and gas from purification plants as well as the bio-degradable proportion of waste from households and the industry.<br><br>The target set by the German Government in its energy policy blueprint of at least 35&nbsp;% share of renewable energies on gross electricity consumption by 2020&nbsp;was already achieved in 2017. In subsequent years, the share maintained an increase up to 45.2&nbsp;% by 2020. This development was supported by legal measures, for instance the <abbr title=\"Renewable Energy Sources Act\" tabindex=\"0\">EEG</abbr>. The <abbr title=\"Renewable Energy Sources Act\" tabindex=\"0\">EEG</abbr> requires, among other things, network operators to give priority feed-in to renewable energy. In 2021, the share of renewable energy on gross energy consumption decreased to 41.1&nbsp;% and, thus, is not moving into the direction of the target value for 2030&nbsp;in the short-run. This can be explained by an increment in gross electricity consumption and weather-related decline in electricity production from renewable energy sources. However, even if the past long-term trend of previous years continues, the target for 2030&nbsp;would be missed. Moreover, the previous target of the Federal Government to derive 65&nbsp;% of the electricity from renewable resources by 2030&nbsp;would be missed, if the long-term trend continues. The target of 80&nbsp;% by 2030&nbsp;could only be achieved if the annual increment would be significantly higher than the previous long-term average. Further, an expected increase in electricity consumption exacerbates the achievement of the target value by 2030.<br><br>As in the case of indicator 7.2.a \u201cShare of renewable energies in gross final energy consumption\u201d, with regard to the calculation method it should be noted that external trade in electricity directly influences the denominator of the indicator but not the numerator<sup>1</sup>. Regardless of whether electricity is produced from renewable sources, net exports reduce gross electricity consumption, while net imports increase gross electricity consumption. Since 2003, Germany is a net exporter of electricity and reached the preliminary highest point in 2017. As a consequence, the actual share of renewable energies in gross electricity consumption is overestimated for the respective period.<br><br>Since 2005, the share of renewable energies in electricity generation has risen, particularly because of the increased use of wind power, photovoltaics and biomass. Between 2005&nbsp;and 2021, declining electricity generation from conventional energy sources was offset by an increase of almost 170&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Terawatt hour\" tabindex=\"0\">TWh</abbr> in the production of electricity from renewable sources. In particular, onshore and offshore electricity generation from wind power soared from 27.8&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Terawatt hour\" tabindex=\"0\">TWh</abbr> in 2005&nbsp;to 114&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Terawatt hour\" tabindex=\"0\">TWh</abbr> in 2021.

The public sector accounts for a considerable share of demand for products and services. It is therefore aimed that establishing sustainable development as a guiding principle of public procurement and reinforcing sustainability criteria within public procurement will serve as a lever to increase provision of sustainable products. The Federal Government\u2019s aim is to strengthen sustainability across public procurement generally.","data_state":"The data published in the indicator report 2022 is as of 31 October 2022.

The Blue Angel is an ecolabel for environmentally friendly products and services. When awarded to paper, it means that 100&nbsp;% of the paper fibres were recovered from wastepaper and that no harmful chemicals or bleaching agents were used in the production process.<br><br>According to the preliminary data, the proportion of Blue Angel-certified paper rose by around 113&nbsp;% between 2015&nbsp;and 2020. In 2015, 45&nbsp;% of all the paper used by the direct federal administration bore the Blue Angel label; that figure had risen to 96&nbsp;% by 2020. This equates to an increase of 112.9&nbsp;% (or an index value of 212.9). The indicator is thus in line with the target set in the Programme of Sustainability Measures to raise the use of paper with the Blue Angel label to 95&nbsp;% by 2020. Total paper consumption decreased in 2020&nbsp;by 14.1&nbsp;% compared to previous year (from about 993&nbsp;to 852&nbsp;million sheet of paper), resulting in a 33.4&nbsp;% reduction in total paper consumption between 2015&nbsp;and 2020.<br><br>When comparing the data over time, it should be noted that there was a change in methodology in 2018&nbsp;regarding the definition of paper. Since the 2018&nbsp;reporting year, only non-coloured A4-sized printer and copier paper has been included in the data. The reduction in total paper use can in part be traced to this methodological change.<br><br>More generally, it should be noted that the use of Blue Angel-certified paper has limited relevance in terms of sustainable procurement overall, as paper accounts for a small proportion of the total financial volumes involved in procurement for the public sector.<br><br><b><i><abbr title=\"Carbon dioxide\" tabindex=\"0\">CO\u2082</abbr> emissions of motor vehicles of the public sector mileage</i></b><br><br>The data on publicly owned vehicles are provided by the environmental economic accounts compiled by the Federal Statistical Office using the <abbr title=\"Transport Emission Model\" tabindex=\"0\">TREMOD</abbr> (Transport Emissions Estimation Model) database at the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research. The public sector comprises the Federal Government, the L\u00e4nder and municipalities, the police, the Federal Border Police and the fire services.<br><br>Due to methodological changes in 2016, the comparability of the data is limited.<br><br>If, instead of looking at publicly owned vehicles, one focuses on vehicles owned by the direct federal administration, average <abbr title=\"Carbon dioxide\" tabindex=\"0\">CO\u2082</abbr> emissions amounted to 223.6&nbsp;grams per kilometre travelled in 2020.<br><br>The direct federal administration encompasses Federal Government\u2019s own central and subordinate authorities, which are legally dependent. The data on <abbr title=\"Carbon dioxide\" tabindex=\"0\">CO\u2082</abbr> emissions per kilometre travelled for vehicles owned by the direct federal administration are provided by German Environment Agency. As for the data on publicly owned vehicles, the direct federal administration figures count all passenger vehicles weighing up to 3.5&nbsp;tonnes but not light commercial vehicles within that class.<br><br>Between 2015&nbsp;and 2017, the proportion of vehicles newly acquired for the direct federal administration that produced emissions lower than 50&nbsp;grams <abbr title=\"Carbon dioxide\" tabindex=\"0\">CO\u2082</abbr> per kilometre rose from 2.6&nbsp;% to 4.1&nbsp;% of all newly purchased vehicles. That share fell back to 3.3&nbsp;% in 2018. The provisional data show it falling further in 2019, to 2.4&nbsp;%, however, the value increased to 8.5&nbsp;% in 2020.<br><br>The indicator under consideration here relates only to the environmental aspect of sustainability. Moreover, it only covers the <abbr title=\"Carbon dioxide\" tabindex=\"0\">CO\u2082</abbr> emissions released during the vehicles\u2019 operation. Looking at their entire life-cycle costs, there are more greenhouse-gas emissions, occurring during the processes of manufacturing and waste disposal, which would have to be taken into account for a conclusive indicator. In addition, the sustainability of electric vehicles depends on whether the electricity powering them comes from conventional or renewable sources.","embedded_feature_html":"<p>Additional data series for the indicator can be found <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/AddInfos/en/12_3_ab.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" >here</a>.</p><br><small>Note: You can display the PDF document directly in your browser or download the PDF document and open it with a PDF reader of your choice.

For that reason, the German Federal Government has set itself the target of increasing the proportion of fathers receiving parental allowance to 65&nbsp;% by 2030.","data_state":"The data published in the indicator report 2022 is as of 31 October 2022. The data shown on this platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/assets/Publikationen/Indikatorenberichte/2022.pdf\">indicator report 2022</a>.","indicator_name":"Proportion of fathers receiving parental allowance","section":"Equality","postulate":"Promoting equal opportunities in society","target_id":"5.1.1","previous":"5-1-bc","next":"5-1-e","content_and_progress":"<b>Text from the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/assets/Publikationen/Indikatorenberichte/2022.pdf\">Indicator Report 2022&nbsp;</a></b><br><br>The Federal Parental Allowance and Parental Leave Act (Bundeselterngeld- und Elternzeitgesetz) introduced parental allowance as a family benefit in respect of children born on or after 1&nbsp;January 2007. To be eligible, claimants must have a permanent or common residence in Germany, live in the same household as their child, look after and bring up that child themselves and not engage in paid employment or, as the case may be, in full-time paid employment. Mothers and fathers are equally entitled.<br><br>Even if the child is not his or her natural child, the spouse or civil partner of the natural mother or father may receive parental allowance if both spouses or partners live in the same household. In more than 99&nbsp;% of cases, however, the beneficiaries are the biological parents, so that in the following simplified reference is made to mothers and fathers.<br><br>The figure for fathers receiving a share of parental allowance represents the percentage of children whose fathers received parental allowance as a percentage of all children born in a particular year for whom parental allowance was received. The existing numbers are based on completed payments of parental allowances for children of a specific year of birth. As a result, the numbers can only be calculated two years after the end of the respective year of birth. For the children born in 2008, fathers received parental allowance in 21.2&nbsp;% of cases, and this figure rose to 43.5&nbsp;% by 2019. The proportion of children whose mothers received parental allowance in the same period was far higher, amounting to about 98&nbsp;% in every year.<br><br>Although the percentage of fathers receiving parental allowance increased over time, the average period for which they received the allowance declined slightly from 3.7&nbsp;months for children born in 2008&nbsp;to 3.3&nbsp;months for children born in 2019.<br><br>These two effects also impacted on the development of the overall average period for which parental allowance was received by all fathers, <abbr title=\"that is to say (id est)\" tabindex=\"0\">i.e.</abbr> including those who did not receive any allowance. At the same time, the increase in the percentage of fathers receiving the allowance outweighed the decline in the period of receipt. The average period for which fathers in general obtained parental allowance increased from 0.8&nbsp;of a month for children born in 2008&nbsp;to 1.4&nbsp;months for those born in 2019. By comparison, the average period for which mothers in general received parental allowance rose from 11.5&nbsp;months for children born in 2008&nbsp;to 13.5&nbsp;months for those born in 2019.<br><br>The indicator is based on data from the parental allowance statistics, in which all payments of personal allowance are recorded on a quarterly basis. The data relates in each case to the year of birth of the child for whom the allowance has been granted. The figure used to calculate the value of the indicator is the number of children for whom parental allowance was actually granted, not the total number of children born in Germany. This is intended to avoid the inclusion in the calculation of children for whom there is no entitlement to parental allowance, such as the children of foreign asylum-seekers.<br><br>It is not yet possible to differentiate precisely on the basis of the parental allowance statistics between types of partnership in which the eligible persons are living, <abbr title=\"that is to say (id est)\" tabindex=\"0\">i.e.</abbr> whether it is a same-sex partnership. Therefore, for the purpose of calculating the indicator, it is assumed for simplification that exactly one father is entitled to benefits for each child.<br><br>For children born before 1&nbsp;July 2015, the maximum period for which parental allowance could be received was 14&nbsp;months. Parents whose children were born on or after 1&nbsp;July 2015&nbsp;are able to choose between basic parental allowance, parental allowance plus or a combination of both and can also obtain an additional partnership bonus in the form of four extra monthly payments of parental allowance plus. As a result, the period of receipt can be considerably extended.","embedded_feature_html":"<p>Additional data series for the indicator can be found <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/AddInfos/en/5_1_d.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" >here</a>.</p><br><small>Note: You can display the PDF document directly in your browser or download the PDF document and open it with a PDF reader of your choice.

Therefore, it only expresses the relative average gross hourly earnings as a ratio without considering the underlying causes, such as qualification, occupation or a different employment history.<br><br>The data for the indicator is based on the four-yearly structure of earnings survey conducted by the statistical offices of the L\u00e4nder as a representative sample survey covering a maximum of 60,000&nbsp;businesses who are obliged to provide the requested information.

For the interim years, the unadjusted <abbr title=\"Gender pay gap\" tabindex=\"0\">GPG</abbr> is updated using the rates of change from the quarterly survey of earnings.

The latest available findings date from 2018. The factors that determine pay differentials are subject to long-term evolution processes and are therefore fairly stable over the course of time. The findings show that structural causes account for 71&nbsp;% of the <abbr title=\"Gender pay gap\" tabindex=\"0\">GPG</abbr>, in other words the differences are partly due to the fact that women often work in sectors and occupations where pay rates are low, and they more rarely attain managerial positions.

The data record fuel consumption associated with passenger transport within Germany, irrespective of where refuelling takes place (in accordance with the principle of actual final consumption). \u201cFinal energy\u201d refers to that part of the total energy used that is directly consumed in transport, so it excludes conversion losses that arise during the production of fuels as well as any pipeline losses that may occur.<br><br>The volume of passenger transport is expressed in terms of the number of passenger-kilometres travelled. Provided by <abbr title=\"Transport Emission Model\" tabindex=\"0\">TREMOD</abbr>, this figure is used to calculate the specific level of energy consumption in this sector. In the aviation statistics, only domestic flights are taken into account. International flights departing from or landing in German territory are not counted. Nor is waterborne passenger transport included.<br><br>Some 27.2&nbsp;% of overall final energy consumption can be attributed to transport. Of this, 65.3&nbsp;%<sup>1</sup> is accounted for by passenger transport. Savings in final energy consumption in passenger transport therefore have a marked effect on total energy consumption in Germany. The number of passenger-kilometres provides information about the extent to which transport intensity (changes of rail or air passenger numbers per kilometres travelled) changes. In addition to final energy consumption, the indicator also examines energy efficiency in passenger transport, measured in terms of energy consumption per passenger-kilometre.<br><br>Final energy consumption in passenger transport decreased by a total of 14.5&nbsp;% in the period from 2005&nbsp;to 2020. Thus, final energy consumption in passenger transport is currently developing in a direction which supports the goal of the German strategy for sustainable development.<br><br>Also the number of passenger-kilometres covered decreased by 14.3&nbsp;% between 2005&nbsp;and 2020, such that energy consumption in all forms of transport increased only slightly by 0.2&nbsp;% to 1.63&nbsp;megajoules per passenger-kilometre<sup>2</sup> during the same period. Consequently, efficiency in passenger transport could not be increased. This is essentially because of major restrictions to mobility during the <abbr title=\"Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2\" tabindex=\"0\">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;pandemic. Both energy consumption and transportation volume reduced for rail, air and road transport. Thus, the road transport slightly increased in efficiency by 1.1&nbsp;%, while efficiency in rail and air transport decreased by 13.7&nbsp;% and 56.7&nbsp;%, respectively. The decline in efficiency for rail and air transport can be attributed to lesser train and airplane occupancy during the <abbr title=\"Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2\" tabindex=\"0\">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;pandemic.<br><br>Private motorised transport by car or two-wheeled vehicle accounted for 86.1&nbsp;% of total passenger transport volumes in 2020. Its share in 2019&nbsp;was 80.3&nbsp;%. It can be subdivided into various categories. In 2019&nbsp;(more recent figures not yet available), work-related transport, <abbr title=\"that is to say (id est)\" tabindex=\"0\">i.e.</abbr> commuter traffic and business travel, accounted for the largest share, at 36.6&nbsp;%, followed by recreational transport at 30.9&nbsp;%. Travel for shopping accounted for 17.5&nbsp;%. These purpose-based categories of transport have developed differently since 2005. Work-related travel in particularly has increased significantly (+&nbsp;19.0&nbsp;%), while journeys for recreation or shopping have declined (- 8.9&nbsp;% and &#8209; 2.1&nbsp;% respectively).<br><br><small><sup>1</sup>The sum of shares of goods transport (indicator 11.2.a) and passenger transport (indicator 11.2.b) in proportion to total final energy consumption in transport do not add up to 100&nbsp;%. This discrepancy is caused by different definitions of energy consumption in passenger and goods transport (domestic consumption; source: <abbr title=\"Transport Emission Model\" tabindex=\"0\">TREMOD</abbr>) and total final energy consumption in traffic (domestic sales; source: AG Energiebilanzen).<br><br><sup>2</sup>For a better understanding: the heating value of a litre gasoline is equivalent to 32&nbsp;megajoules. Hence, the consumption of 1.63&nbsp;megajoules per passenger kilometre corresponds to the energy content of 5.1&nbsp;litre gasoline (extrapolated to 100&nbsp;km).</small>","embedded_feature_html":"<p>Additional data series for the indicator can be found <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/AddInfos/en/11_2_b.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" >here</a>.</p><br><small>Note: You can display the PDF document directly in your browser or download the PDF document and open it with a PDF reader of your choice.

Measures taken by other parties, such as the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (<abbr title=\"German Agency for International Cooperation\" tabindex=\"0\">GIZ</abbr>), L\u00e4nder and private aid agencies, are not taken into account. The indicator is based exclusively on the planned scope of new funding commitments for drinking water and sanitation projects at the time of submission of the programme proposal to the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development. The <abbr title=\"Reconstruction Loan Corporation\" tabindex=\"0\">KfW</abbr> assesses the number of people who, following completion of the construction projects, will have obtained first-time or improved access to drinking water and sanitation or will be able to benefit from the constructed facilities. Whether people are actually reached cannot be estimated in practice until the infrastructure has become operational, and this is not what the indicator shows. Since a person may obtain first-time or improved access to both drinking water and sanitation, double counting is possible between the two indicators and between two years. The funding granted by the <abbr title=\"Reconstruction Loan Corporation\" tabindex=\"0\">KfW</abbr> comprises grants and loans financed from the federal budget and funds raised in the financial markets. The recipients are generally developing and emerging countries, which means that this indicator is related to indicator 17.1&nbsp;\u201cOfficial development assistance as a proportion of gross national income\u201d.<br><br>In 2019&nbsp;the data collection method was revised. Whereas the indicator previously counted people who were reached either directly, <abbr title=\"for example (exempli gratia)\" tabindex=\"0\">e.g.</abbr> by domestic connections, or indirectly, <abbr title=\"for example (exempli gratia)\" tabindex=\"0\">e.g.</abbr> the entire population of a country supported by a sectoral reform programme, it now covers only those people who are reached directly. In 2017, for instance, of the total of 28.6&nbsp;million recorded beneficiaries, 19.1&nbsp;million were reached directly. In 2018, 15.2&nbsp;million out of a total of 60.3&nbsp;million were direct beneficiaries. Another change lies in the fact that the figure is based only on the proportion of beneficiaries who have been reached by German-funded share of measures. Contributions made by other donors and the efforts of the host country itself are not counted. Similarly, no consideration is given to energy-efficiency measures, improvements to operational processes or renewals of pumping stations, since these do not lead directly to improved access for the target group.<br><br>In recent years, the planned numbers of people who were to obtain access to drinking water and sanitation with German support have always been above the target of ten million. Under the revised methodology, the planned numbers of people who were to obtain first-time or improved access in 2020&nbsp;were about 10.9&nbsp;million for drinking water and 1.8&nbsp;million for wastewater and sanitation. The target of the indicator 6.2.a was achieved for the year 2020, however, the target value for indicator 6.2.b was significantly below the intended level. In the preceding year, more than four million people were reached by German support and have received access to sanitation facilities.<br><br>The commitments made by the <abbr title=\"Reconstruction Loan Corporation\" tabindex=\"0\">KfW</abbr> with regard to drinking water and sanitation rose by 26.0&nbsp;% from 2012&nbsp;to 2018&nbsp;to more than 1&nbsp;billion euros. In 2019&nbsp;and 2020, these decreased to 677.1&nbsp;million euros.

The phosphorous pollution of rivers is measured by the L\u00e4nder as part of the monitoring conducted for the <abbr title=\"European Union\" tabindex=\"0\">EU</abbr> Water Framework Directive. The data for the indicator come from the monitoring network, which consists of about 250&nbsp;monitoring points. In most cases, the monitoring points were installed in the main currents of the large rivers and at the junction of important confluents. The data are compiled by the German Environment Agency based on information from the German Working Group on Water Issues of the L\u00e4nder and the Federal Government represented by the Federal Environment Ministry (<abbr title=\"German Working Group on Water Issues of the L\u00e4nder and the Federal Government\" tabindex=\"0\">LAWA</abbr>).<br><br>The indicator shows whether the annual average of the values measured at a particular monitoring point was equal to, or lower than, the benchmark value. However, it does not show by how far the target was surpassed if it was exceeded. The information about the individual monitoring points is presented in a summarised form. Accordingly, the value of the indicator is strongly dependent on the number of monitoring points and the representative status of their distribution. Lakes and other standing waters are not covered by the indicator.<br><br>Since the different bodies of water react with differing levels of sensitivity to nutrients such as phosphorous, the precise benchmark values vary. The vast majority of flowing waters use the benchmark value of 0.1&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\" tabindex=\"0\">mg/l</abbr> of phosphorous. In organic substrate-dominated rivers, the benchmark value is 0.15&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\" tabindex=\"0\">mg/l</abbr>, for marshland streams 0.3&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\" tabindex=\"0\">mg/l</abbr> and for transitional waters influenced by tidal movement 0.045&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\" tabindex=\"0\">mg/l</abbr>.<br><br>In 2020, the annual average of values measured was below the benchmark value at 41.7&nbsp;% of the monitoring points at rivers. 52.6&nbsp;% of the monitoring points showed average concentrations of up to twice the benchmark value, while 2.9&nbsp;% of the monitoring points were in the range of up to four times the benchmark value (not shown in the chart). The remaining 2.8&nbsp;% showed even higher concentrations.<br><br>When viewed over time, the proportion of monitoring points not exceeding the benchmark value has continuously increased and has doubled since 1990. However, the percentage rate of monitoring points with concentrations of up to twice the benchmark value almost tripled during the same period. Conversely, the share of monitoring points with even higher values has fallen significantly since the early 1990s. The level of pollution has been reduced significantly thanks in particular to the introduction of phosphate-free detergents and the specification of threshold values for the discharge of treated waste water.<br><br>If one examines the average trend of the last five years, the indicator has improved to a minor degree. The goal of not exceeding the specified threshold value at all monitoring points cannot be achieved if the current trend continues.<br><br>The indicators of phosphorous and nitrate levels (6.1.a and 6.1.b) cover two key aspects of water quality. However, there are other, additional components such as the existence of natural habitats around water bodies and the exposure to pollutants (such as pesticides, metals, medicines), all of which are also relevant to water quality.","embedded_feature_html":"<p>Additional data series for the indicator can be found <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/AddInfos/en/6_1_a.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" >here</a>.</p><br><small>Note: You can display the PDF document directly in your browser or download the PDF document and open it with a PDF reader of your choice.

It thereby makes them easily accessible, in an up-to-date manner, to scholars and anyone else interested in culture. As such, the indicator is a useful gauge of the extent to which our shared heritage of culture and learning has been rendered digitally accessible in Germany. The goal is to increase the number of objects available via the German Digital Library to 50&nbsp;million by 2030.","data_state":"The data published in the indicator report 2022 is as of 31 October 2022. The data shown on this platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/assets/Publikationen/Indikatorenberichte/2022.pdf\">indicator report 2022</a>.","indicator_name":"Number of objects in the German Digital Library","section":"Cultural heritage","postulate":"Improving access to cultural heritage","target_id":"11.4.1","previous":"11-3","next":"12-1-a","content_and_progress":"<b>Text from the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/assets/Publikationen/Indikatorenberichte/2022.pdf\">Indicator Report 2022&nbsp;</a></b><br><br>The German Digital Library is a platform created to connect the digital holdings of institutions like archives, libraries and museums. It is managed by a network of such repositories of culture and learning from the Federal Government, the L\u00e4nder and local-authorities. <br><br>It is jointly funded by the Federal Government and the L\u00e4nder. Most of the digital materials are held not by the German Digital Library itself but by partner institutions, while the <abbr title=\"German Digital Library\" tabindex=\"0\">DDB</abbr> only hosts links to those objects. The partner institutions are responsible for the stability of the connection. As of May 2020, the number of partner institutions making data available for the German Digital Library had reached 448. The majority are museums or archives&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;183&nbsp;and 174&nbsp;of them respectively.<br><br>The German Digital Library online platform has been accessible since 2012, at which point it hosted links to 5.6&nbsp;million objects. By the middle of 2022, that number had risen to 42.3&nbsp;million. If the trend continues as it has to date, the target of 50&nbsp;million by 2030&nbsp;could be achieved. Some of the objects made available by libraries may repeat the same content; for example, two libraries might post links in the German Digital Library to the same edition of a book. In such cases, the two links are counted separately.<br><br>Since 2015, it has been possible to differentiate between objects with and without digitised media. For those with digitised content, the German Digital Library link gives direct access to the digitised reproduction of the book, certificate, painting or other object in question. For objects without digitised media, on the other hand, the links lead only to information about them. The link pertaining to a painting, for instance, will provide information about who painted it, what year it is from and where it is kept. Objects with digitised media thus provide a good deal more information than those for which only metadata are made available.<br><br>There were 6.3&nbsp;million objects with digitised media at the end of 2015, rising to 14.9&nbsp;million by the middle of 2022. Objects with digitised media also increased as a proportion of all the objects linked to in the German Digital Library, rising from around 34.5&nbsp;% in 2015&nbsp;to around 35.2&nbsp;% by mid-2022. At the end of the first half of 2022, the majority of digitised objects available via the Library were texts (61.8&nbsp;%), followed by pictures (34.9&nbsp;%) and other media (2.8&nbsp;%). In contrast, audio and video recordings made up only a very small proportion of digitised Library objects, at 0.3&nbsp;% and 0.2&nbsp;% respectively.","embedded_feature_html":"<p>Additional data series for the indicator can be found <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/AddInfos/en/11_4.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" >here</a>.</p><br><small>Note: You can display the PDF document directly in your browser or download the PDF document and open it with a PDF reader of your choice.

The figures are collated on behalf of the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure and published on the Government\u2019s Broadband Atlas.<br><br>As of the middle of 2021, fully fibre-optic internet connections (<abbr title=\"Fibre-to-the-Building/Fibre-to-the-Home\" tabindex=\"0\">FTTB/H</abbr>) capable of more than 1,000&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Megabit per second\" tabindex=\"0\">Mbps</abbr> were available in 15.4&nbsp;% of households in Germany. Between 2015&nbsp;and 2021, the availability of 1,000&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Megabit per second\" tabindex=\"0\">Mbps</abbr> FTTB/H broadband rose by 8.7&nbsp;percentage points. In other words, it more than doubled, increasing by +&nbsp;130&nbsp;%.

This is also more than double, equating to a +&nbsp;138&nbsp;% increase. Altogether, 62.1&nbsp;% of households had gigabit-capable connections available as of mid-2021.<br><br>For all technologies, the provision of gigabit broadband is concentrated particularly in urban areas, where some 78.4&nbsp;% of households had gigabit-speed internet access as of 2021. That figure is markedly lower for areas of a rural character, at 22.9&nbsp;% in 2021. To consider the distribution of the different technologies, 75.1&nbsp;% of urban and 12.8&nbsp;% of rural households had gigabit connections via <abbr title=\"Cable television\" tabindex=\"0\">CATV</abbr> in mid-2021, while gigabit-capable fibre broadband was available to 18.6&nbsp;% of households in urban areas and 11.3&nbsp;% of those in rural areas.<br><br>Differences in availability between urban and more rural areas are also discernible among the L\u00e4nder. Of all the L\u00e4nder that are not city states, Schleswig-Holstein has the highest level of gigabit-speed provision using any technology in 2021, at 79.7&nbsp;% of all households, followed by Lower Saxony on 66.8&nbsp;%. At the other end of the scale, 26&nbsp;% of households in Saxony-Anhalt can say the same, with Brandenburg the next-lowest at 29.4&nbsp;%. In contrast, provision of gigabit-speed broadband is markedly higher than 90&nbsp;% in the three city states, Berlin, Bremen and Hamburg.<br><br>The foundation for the distinction between urban and rural areas is solely the population density for this indicator. The information about gigabit broadband are collected from more than 150&nbsp;telecommunications companies in Germany. They are asked about their current provision. To preserve the companies\u2019 business and trade secrets, the resultant data are aggregated into a grid of 250-metre by 250-metre cells (from 2022: 100x100&nbsp;metre) and grouped according to seven classes of broadband. Although full-fibre networks with speeds of over 1,000&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Megabit per second\" tabindex=\"0\">Mbps</abbr> have been included in observations since the end of 2015, that class has only been studied in detail since the end of 2018&nbsp;in light of the latest technological advances.<br><br>Methodologically, it should be noted that the telecom companies provide their data on broadband availability on a voluntary basis until the revision of the Telecommunications Act on 1&nbsp;December 2021. Furthermore, the figures for availability refer to the technology that telecom companies have installed, as opposed to the actually usable broadband capacity in the area.

Both are complete surveys based on the administrative data of the institutions of higher education. The indicator includes the students in the winter semester of each year. However, the researchers are covered on the reference date of 1st of December.

With 91.9&nbsp;%, students by far accounted for the largest share of the indicator value.<br><br>In the winter semester of 2021/22, 290,453&nbsp;students from developing and emerging countries were enrolled in German institutions of higher education. This corresponds to 9.9&nbsp;% of all enrollees. The number of students from developing and emerging countries has increased steadily since 2005/06&nbsp;(134,462&nbsp;students)&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;the only decline recorded was during winter semester of 2007/08. The increase in the winter semester of 2021/22&nbsp;was around 5.6&nbsp;% compared to the previous year (about 275,000&nbsp;students in the winter semester of 2020/21). In the winter semester of 2021/22, a total of 17,113&nbsp;students came from <abbr title=\"Least developed countries\" tabindex=\"0\">LDCs</abbr>, 13.7&nbsp;% more than in the previous year.<br><br>Of the students from developing and emerging countries, 43,629&nbsp;came from China, 36,575&nbsp;from Turkey and 34,134&nbsp;from India. In total, 41.6&nbsp;% of them were female. Whereas the European (54.2&nbsp;%) and American (50.4&nbsp;%) developing and emerging countries send roughly equal numbers of women and men to study in Germany, less than a third of students from African developing and emerging countries are women (32.8&nbsp;%).

They accounted for 6.0&nbsp;% of all academic staff at German institutions of higher education. The proportion of people from developing and emerging countries was thus markedly smaller among researchers than among students. Their numbers increased by 10.6&nbsp;% compared to the previous year and have more than quadrupled since 2005. A total of 924&nbsp;researchers came from <abbr title=\"Least developed countries\" tabindex=\"0\">LDCs</abbr> in 2021&nbsp;(0.2&nbsp;% of all academic staff).

Therefore, the number of fish stocks that are sustainably managed based on the <abbr title=\"Maximum Sustainable Yield\" tabindex=\"0\">MSY</abbr> approach should always be viewed in relation to overall fish stocks. Although an expansion of the investigation to include as many stocks as possible is desirable, the high cost of these investigations means that the prospect of recording all stocks, even those that are economically less relevant and less fished, is unrealistic. Based on current estimates, a total of 58&nbsp;fish stocks in the North Sea and 20&nbsp;stocks in the Baltic Sea are used for economic purposes. The number of stocks examined using the <abbr title=\"Maximum Sustainable Yield\" tabindex=\"0\">MSY</abbr> approach is currently eight in the Baltic Sea and 22&nbsp;in the North Sea. This means that only a third of all managed stocks are fully analysed with respect to sustainable management. All other stocks for which the data available are not sufficient for analysis according to the <abbr title=\"Maximum Sustainable Yield\" tabindex=\"0\">MSY</abbr> method are not included in this indicator.<br><br>A stock is considered to be \u201csustainably managed\u201d if the actual amount of fish caught per year and the fish stock do not exceed the scientifically recommended amount based on the <abbr title=\"Maximum Sustainable Yield\" tabindex=\"0\">MSY</abbr> approach, or if they comply with the requirements of a long-term management plan assessed as sustainable according to the <abbr title=\"Maximum Sustainable Yield\" tabindex=\"0\">MSY</abbr> approach. In this context, a \u201cfish stock\u201c is defined as an independently reproducing population of a specific species of fish. A specific species can therefore have multiple stocks and, depending on the stock, can also have different guideline values regarding the amount of fish caught. As a rule, each stock is assigned a guideline value according to its previous development.<br><br>The guideline values for the managed stocks are calculated by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. Data is collected for the whole North and Baltic Sea in order to calculate the indicator. Accordingly, a distinction between the values for German territorial waters and the exclusive economic zone for Germany is not feasible.<br><br>The annual calculation of the amounts of fish caught sustainably according to the <abbr title=\"Maximum Sustainable Yield\" tabindex=\"0\">MSY</abbr> approach is based on stochastic predictions, which use calculations of historical stock trends. Information about fish quantities landed is based on reported catches. Samples taken from this provide insights into the demographic parameters of the population, such as age and size. Other important sources of information on the state of fish stocks are scientific surveys conducted on research vessels that are independent of the fishing industry. Indicator values of previous years are subject to retrospective changes due to new estimates on an annual basis for the time series and updates with regards to the relevant fish species.<br><br>In 2020, the sustainably managed stocks of fish accounted for 60.0&nbsp;% of the total stocks examined in accordance with the <abbr title=\"Maximum Sustainable Yield\" tabindex=\"0\">MSY</abbr> approach in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. The relevant proportions were 59.1&nbsp;% in the North Sea and 62.5&nbsp;% in the Baltic Sea. Regarding the development between 2015&nbsp;and 2020, the overall progress was positive. The target to sustainably manage economically relevant fish stocks according to the <abbr title=\"Maximum Sustainable Yield\" tabindex=\"0\">MSY</abbr> approach was missed.<br><br>It is difficult to assess the indicator because it is influenced in addition to the development of the stocks, also by the selection of stocks to be considered. Thus, the basis of assessment can vary from year to year, which makes it difficult to compare the results of individual years. In addition, the recommended amounts of fish caught apply across countries and therefore can only be fulfilled indirectly by the efforts of a single country alone.","embedded_feature_html":"<p>Additional data series for the indicator can be found <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/AddInfos/en/14_1_b.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" >here</a>.</p><br><small>Note: You can display the PDF document directly in your browser or download the PDF document and open it with a PDF reader of your choice.

It has a value between 0&nbsp;and 1. The value 0&nbsp;means that every person has exactly the same income whereas the value 1&nbsp;indicates that only one person receives all the income, thereby representing a situation of maximum income inequality. Hence, the smaller the Gini-coefficient, the more evenly is the income distributed.<br><br>The equivalised income is a value derived from the total income of a household and the number and age of the people living from this income. With the help of an equivalence scale, the incomes are weighted according to household size and composition, as the shared use of living space and household appliances results in savings (Economies of Scale). With the equivalised income then allocated equally to each household member, it becomes possible to compare people\u2019s incomes independently of age or household size. A household\u2019s equivalised disposable income is the income, including social transfers, which remains after taxes and other deductions, and is therefore the income available for spending and saving. A distinction must be made between this measure and equivalised income before social transfers, which looks at disposable income without any possible welfare payments, such as unemployment benefit or housing assistance, or market income, which is calculated before taxes, social contributions and social benefits. In none of these ways of looking at income is a differentiation made between the sources of income, <abbr title=\"that is to say (id est)\" tabindex=\"0\">i.e.</abbr> whether it takes the form of wages, rental income or capital gains.<br><br>The data used to calculate equivalised income come from the annual harmonised European statistics on income and living conditions (<abbr title=\"European Union\" tabindex=\"0\">EU</abbr> SILC) and are incorporated with extensive methodological changes into the microcensus due to increasing requirements on data with respect to actuality and provision of more detailed regional results in survey year 2020. Thus, the results from 2020&nbsp;on are not comparable with previous years. Since <abbr title=\"EU-Statistics on Income and Living Conditions\" tabindex=\"0\">EU-SILC</abbr> is not yet drawn upon to calculate a Gini coefficient for market income, data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (<abbr title=\"Socio-Economic Panel\" tabindex=\"0\">SOEP</abbr>) of the German Institute for Economic Research are used for this purpose. The fact that households with high income and extensive assets are under-represented in voluntary sample surveys is methodologically compensated for.<br><br>As in previous years, the Gini coefficient of the equivalised disposable income for Germany (2021: 0.309) almost equals that for the European Union (2021: 0.301). Thus, there are no significant differences in income distribution between Germany and Europe. In 2021, the Gini-coefficient of equivalised disposable income was above the respective value of the <abbr title=\"European Union\" tabindex=\"0\">EU</abbr>, such that the target of the Federal Government was missed. Furthermore, the Gini coefficient of the equivalised disposable income is well below the Gini coefficient of the equivalised disposable income before social benefits without pensions (0.309&nbsp;as compared with 0.376). As expected, the Gini coefficient of market income was even higher at 0.497&nbsp;(2019). In Germany, social benefits, social insurance and taxes thus contribute considerably to reducing inequalities in disposable income.<br><br>The wealth distribution figures for Germany are taken from the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS) conducted on an irregular basis by the European Central Bank and show a clear uneven distribution. Turning to the corresponding Gini coefficient (2017: 0.739), wealth in Germany is much less evenly distributed than income. The gap to the respective European value (Eurozone 2017: 0.695) is substantial and the European value is lower than the value for Germany. However, the impression of there being a disproportionately high wealth inequality is qualified by several factors not covered by the Gini coefficient. For instance, the evaluation of wealth does not take into account future pension entitlements. In addition, due to the stricter protection of tenants\u2019 rights, people in Germany are more likely to rent than own their homes, compared to other European countries.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/destatis.png\" alt=\"Federal Statistical Office\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Statistical Office\" style=\"height:60px;

The indicator shows the number of members of the Textiles Partnership. Being a multi-stakeholder initiative, the Textiles Partnership has more than just business enterprises in its ranks. On the basis of jointly defined Partnership objectives, each company, by joining the Textiles Partnership, pledges to implement measures for continuous improvement of conditions and for compliance with social and environmental objectives of the Partnership throughout the company\u2019s supply chain.<br><br>In its founding year of 2014, 59&nbsp;members joined the Textiles Partnership, including 26&nbsp;companies. The end of 2016&nbsp;saw membership reach its peak, having more than trebled to 188, including 133&nbsp;companies. Since the introduction of the compulsory plans of action (Roadmaps) in 2017, however, there have been expulsions and several withdrawals from the Textiles Partnership. On the one hand, some members were expelled for non-fulfilment of their reporting obligations. On the other hand, some members withdrew, citing compliance costs or insufficient relevance. Thus, total membership stood at 123&nbsp;at the end of December 2021. Of the original 59&nbsp;founding members that joined in the period from October to December 2014, there were still 26&nbsp;in the Partnership at the end of December 2021, whereby the Federal Government counts as one member instead of three in comparison to 2014. Over that five-year period there was an overall downward trend in the number of members.<br><br>At the end of December 2021, 69&nbsp;out of 123&nbsp;members (56&nbsp;%) were classified as companies; eight of them did not have their registered office in Germany. The Textiles Partnership consisted of 85&nbsp;companies out of the 136&nbsp;members in the preceding year. This decline reflects, that companies who are member in Textiles Partnership were obliged in 2020&nbsp;for implementation of due diligence along the supply chain. This includes the analysis and prioritisation of social and ecological risks in the supply chain as well as the derivation of targets and measures for mitigation or reduction of these risks. Member companies have to report about the status of implementation of due diligence every other year. If a company is a member of the Textiles Partnership, this does not necessarily mean that its main economic activity is in the field of textiles and/or clothing manufacture. According to the statistical business register of the Federal Statistical Office in 2020, only about two thirds of 61&nbsp;member companies operated primarily in the manufacture, wholesaling or retailing of textiles and/or clothing. Their aggregate turnover in 2020&nbsp;amounted to 16.1&nbsp;billion euros. According to the trade statistics of the Federal Statistical Office, total retail turnover for the whole of 2020&nbsp;amounted to 635.2&nbsp;billion euros, while total wholesale turnover came to 1,363.0&nbsp;billion euros. About 4.1&nbsp;% of these amounts were earned by companies primarily assigned to the wholesale and retail sector through sales of clothing, textiles and curtains, excluding footwear, leather goods and carpets.","embedded_feature_html":"<p>Additional data series for the indicator can be found <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/AddInfos/en/8_6.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" >here</a>.</p><br><small>Note: You can display the PDF document directly in your browser or download the PDF document and open it with a PDF reader of your choice.

Particulate matter, however, can also occur through the formation of secondary particles as a result of chemical reactions with precursors such as sulphur oxide, nitrogen oxides, ammonia and organic carbon.<br><br>The particulate matter (<abbr title=\"Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 10&nbsp;micrometers)\" tabindex=\"0\">PM\u2081\u2080</abbr>) contained in the air is measured at a total of more than 370&nbsp;air monitoring sites in both metropolitan and rural areas of Germany. For methodological reasons, the indicator is based only on the readings from the monitoring sites that are not exposed to direct particulate emissions from traffic or to any other significant local sources, because these measure only high localised concentrations (hot spots) and not area-wide particulate air pollution. From a combination of model results with the measured monitoring data on background concentrations, the particulate concentrations for the whole area of Germany are obtained. These concentrations are combined with information on population distribution to determine the number of persons who are exposed to annual mean particulate pollution of more than 20&nbsp;micrograms per cubic metre of air at their place of residence. Rather than indicating nationwide compliance with the guideline value, the indicator merely shows that the value is not exceeded at the population\u2019s places of residence. Neither does it give any indication of the exposure level of the population in total nor its variation in the course of the year. Since the modelled calculation is based only on measuring stations that are not exposed to direct particular matter emissions from local sources, it may well be assumed that the indicator underestimates the level of pollution. In addition, this indicator makes no provision for the separate analysis of pollution caused by finer particulate matter particles (<abbr title=\"Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 2.5&nbsp;micrometers)\" tabindex=\"0\">PM\u2082.\u2085</abbr> and <abbr title=\"Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 0.1&nbsp;micrometers)\" tabindex=\"0\">PM\u2080,\u2081</abbr>).<br><br>The last few years from 2007&nbsp;to 2020&nbsp;have seen a significant reduction in particulate matter pollution caused by <abbr title=\"Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 10&nbsp;micrometers)\" tabindex=\"0\">PM\u2081\u2080</abbr>.

During the same period, the number of people exposed to an annual average of more than 20&nbsp;\u00b5g <abbr title=\"Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 10&nbsp;micrometers)\" tabindex=\"0\">PM\u2081\u2080</abbr> per <abbr title=\"Cubic metre\" tabindex=\"0\">m\u00b3</abbr> of air at their place of residence has also fallen considerably&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;from around 29.7&nbsp;million people in 2007&nbsp;to only around 400,000&nbsp;people in 2020.<br><br>Weather also influences the measurements of airborne particulate matter. Part of the reason for the sharp drop in 2011&nbsp;and subsequent years is presumably that there were relatively few instances of temperature inversion in the winter months, although that curve has flattened out since 2015. Depending on wind speed, direction and air temperature, particulate matter may be transported into other regions and countries or else, during inversions, may become more concentrated at its place of origin.<br><br>If the average development of the past few years continues, it is likely that the achieved target of exposing the population nationwide to a background particulate matter pollution of less than 20&nbsp;micrograms per cubic meter of air on an annual average can be sustained.","embedded_feature_html":"<p>Additional data series for the indicator can be found <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/AddInfos/en/3_2_b.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" >here</a>.</p><br><small>Note: You can display the PDF document directly in your browser or download the PDF document and open it with a PDF reader of your choice.

Programmes are taken into account in the analyses whose objectives fall directly under the heading of pandemic prevention and response or who are primarily intended to enhance relevant capabilities in the field of health care. The programmes cover matters such as the pandemic prevention and response functions of the World Health Organization (<abbr title=\"World Health Organization\" tabindex=\"0\">WHO</abbr>), sanitation, One Health (that is, in interdisciplinary cooperation between human and veterinary medicine and the environmental sector), vaccination infrastructure and research and development, both at home and abroad, in so far as the <abbr title=\"Research and development\" tabindex=\"0\">R&D</abbr> findings and innovations also benefit the countries of the Global South. <br><br>Additionally, programmes launched in response to the <abbr title=\"Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2\" tabindex=\"0\">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;pandemic have also been taken into account. The latter include among others <abbr title=\"World Health Organization\" tabindex=\"0\">WHO</abbr> programmes and activities, humanitarian aid, vaccine development, crisis response and emergency assistance and loans to help health services in countries of the Global South to respond to the crisis. <br><br>As regards the figures, it should be noted that it is not possible to draw hard and fast lines between the content of programmes, since the indicator field is closely interlinked with numerous other areas of the health system. The indicator therefore takes account of a range of programmes, such as Germany\u2019s contribution to the <abbr title=\"World Health Organization\" tabindex=\"0\">WHO</abbr> to support its emergency programme and to provide flexible initial funding for crisis response measures through the Contingency Fund for Emergencies, support for a vaccination programme for the reduction of child mortality in the East African Community, improvement of drinking water supply and sanitation in Burkina Faso and a biosecurity cooperation programme. Besides the thematic prioritisation, it should also be noted that some of the programmes are focused on general reinforcement of global coordination and organisational capacity and therefore do not exclusively benefit countries of the Global South.<br><br>Nor can a precise line be drawn between preventive and reactive measures. Developing preventive capacity may, for example, enhance responsiveness to a pandemic situation, while reactive measures may contribute to capacity-building in the long term.

The source of the annually collected data is the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, which also reports in this context on climate finance from other federal ministries. In the case of bilateral climate finance, expenditure is calculated on the basis of funds allocated; in the case of multilateral climate finance and contributions to energy and climate funds, it is calculated on the basis of funds actually paid. The indicator also includes climate finance that is attributed to donors pro rata on the basis of their contributions to multilateral funds managed by development banks. As climate finance primarily benefits developing countries, it is considered to be part of official development expenditure (see indicator 17.1&nbsp;\u201cOfficial development assistance as a proportion of gross national income\u201d).<br><br>In 2021, Germany committed or provided 5.34&nbsp;billion euros in public funds for international climate finance for the reduction of greenhouse gases and adaptation to climate change. Compared with the previous year, when climate finance amounted to 5.09&nbsp;billion euros, this represents an increase of 4.9&nbsp;%. The target for 2025&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;to reach 6&nbsp;billion euros&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;will most likely be achieved if the development continues. The previous target&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;to reach 4&nbsp;billion euros by 2020&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;was already achieved in 2019&nbsp;at 4.34&nbsp;billion euros. In 2021, 36&nbsp;% of climate finance went to fund projects to reduce emissions, while 33&nbsp;% went towards adaptation to climate change. The remaining 30&nbsp;% was used to finance horizontal measures. As the horizontal measures serve both the reduction and adaptation efforts, the final split in 2021, as in previous years, shows more funds being used for emissions reduction (51&nbsp;%) than for adaptation (49&nbsp;%).<br><br>18&nbsp;% of climate finance, or 971&nbsp;million euros, was provided through multilateral channels in 2021. 268&nbsp;million euros of that can be attributed to Germany on the basis of the climate-related shares of Germany\u2019s contributions to multilateral development banks, the Global Environment Facility and the International Fund for Agricultural Development. Germany provides the remaining 703&nbsp;million euros through multilateral institutions and contributions to international climate funds.<br><br>In addition to official climate finance from public funds, Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (<abbr title=\"Reconstruction Loan Corporation\" tabindex=\"0\">KfW</abbr>) and <abbr title=\"German Investment and Development Corporation\" tabindex=\"0\">DEG</abbr> (Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft) also provide climate-related loans with funds from the market. These represent mobilised public climate finance and are not included in the indicator. In 2021, the resources mobilised in this way amounted to approximately 2.59&nbsp;billion euros, compared with 2.55&nbsp;billion euros the previous year.

As part of the causes of death statistics, all official cause of death certificates are recorded and evaluated. The population statistics specify the current population based on the results of the most recent census. The data refer to the \u201cold\u201d standardised European population. A standard population is a modelled population that makes it possible to compare change rates over time.<br><br>The indicators 3.1.a and 3.1.b are also part of the Federal Health Monitoring information system (www.gbe-bund.de). Those under 1&nbsp;year of age and consequently the infant mortality rate are excluded from the assessment.<br><br>Premature mortality steadily decreased between 1991&nbsp;and 2020, both for women (\u2012&nbsp;38&nbsp;%) and for men (\u2012&nbsp;44&nbsp;%). As a result of this decrease, the gender difference in premature mortality declined, too. In 2020, for example, 145&nbsp;women and 276&nbsp;men per 100,000&nbsp;inhabitants died before they reached the age of 70. If this trend continues unchanged as seen in recent years, the gender-specific targets for 2030&nbsp;will not be achieved.<br><br>The <abbr title=\"Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2\" tabindex=\"0\">COVID-19</abbr>-pandemic caused significantly more deaths in 2020, however, considering the indicators over time, the changes of the values are minor. The mortality in the age group of above 80&nbsp;years old (not considered for the indicators) considerably increased in 2020, while in the age group below 70&nbsp;years 1.7&nbsp;% women and 2.3&nbsp;% men died due to <abbr title=\"Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2\" tabindex=\"0\">COVID-19</abbr>. Therefore, the indicators are less affected by the <abbr title=\"Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2\" tabindex=\"0\">COVID-19</abbr>-pandemic. It is assumed, that a substantial undercoverage of COVID-deaths is not prevalent.<br><br>Life expectancy is an indicator based on death statistics and the intercensal population updates and excludes the effects of population ageing on the development of mortality. In 2020&nbsp;and 2021, the pandemic caused a short-run decline in life expectancy. In the long-run, reflecting the steady decrease in premature mortality, life expectancy in Germany has continued to follow an upward curve. Todays 70-year-old women can, statistically, expect to live another 17.0&nbsp;years and 70-year-old men another 14.3. Between 2019&nbsp;and 2021, the average life expectancy was 83.4&nbsp;years for new-born girls and 78.5&nbsp;years for boys, which was 4.4&nbsp;years higher for girls and 6.1&nbsp;years for boys than the average for the years 1991&nbsp;to 1993. Differences in life expectancy between the western L\u00e4nder and the eastern L\u00e4nder (each excluding Berlin) are for new born girls 0.2&nbsp;years and for new-born boys 1.8&nbsp;years and, thus, significantly decreased. However, the differences between east-west Germany are increasing in size due to the pandemic.<br><br>The largest share of all causes of premature mortality in 2020&nbsp;was malignant neoplasms (35.9&nbsp;%), followed by cardiovascular diseases (19.5&nbsp;%). Deaths due to external causes (such as accidents, poisoning, suicide) accounted for as much as 8.6&nbsp;%. Diseases of the digestive and respiratory tracts contributed 7.3&nbsp;% and 5.2&nbsp;%, respectively, to the causes of death. Since 1991, the shares of malignant neoplasms and diseases of the respiratory tract among all causes of death have increased (by +&nbsp;2.7&nbsp;and +&nbsp;1.2&nbsp;percentage points, respectively). In contrast, causes such as cardiovascular diseases (\u2012&nbsp;11.6&nbsp;percentage points), external causes (\u2012&nbsp;2.4&nbsp;percentage points) and diseases of the digestive tract (\u2012&nbsp;0.3&nbsp;percentage points) have declined.<br><br>Besides factors such as health related behaviour (see, for instance, indicators 3.1.c and 3.1.d on adolescent and adult smoking rates or 3.1.e and 3.1.f on child/adolescent and adult obesity rates), medical care also has an important influence on mortality rates. Health expenditure rose to 440.6&nbsp;billion euros in 2020&nbsp;due to the pandemic and reached a peak. It is equivalent to an annual amount of 5,298&nbsp;euros per capita of population, compared with 4,980&nbsp;euros in 2019. Since the beginning of calculations in 1992, health care expenditures per capita reached a value above 5,000&nbsp;euros for the first time. Health care expenditures amounted to 26.8&nbsp;billion euros in 2020, and, thus, were 6.5&nbsp;% higher than pre-pandemic level in 2019. This level of spending represented 13.1&nbsp;% of the gross domestic product and has increased by 1.2&nbsp;% from the value in 2019.","embedded_feature_html":"<p>Additional data series for the indicator can be found <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/AddInfos/en/3_1_ab.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" >here</a>.</p><br><small>Note: You can display the PDF document directly in your browser or download the PDF document and open it with a PDF reader of your choice.

Following budgetary consolidation measures, the ratio fell from 67.5&nbsp;% in 2005&nbsp;to 64.2&nbsp;% in 2007, but then it rose again to peak at 82.0&nbsp;% in 2010. This increase must be seen in the context of the financial and economic crisis. Since 2012, Germany\u2019s public debt-to-<abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr> ratio steadily decreased to a value of 58.9&nbsp;% in 2019&nbsp;and, thus, dropped below the reference level of 60&nbsp;% determined by the Maastricht Treaty for the first time. Due to the <abbr title=\"Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2\" tabindex=\"0\">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;pandemic, the debt-to-<abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr> ratio increased significantly and reached 68.0&nbsp;% in 2020&nbsp;and 68.6&nbsp;% in 2021.<br><br>In 2021, the debt-to-<abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr> ratio of 13&nbsp;<abbr title=\"European Union\" tabindex=\"0\">EU</abbr>-states fell below the reference value of 60&nbsp;%. The <abbr title=\"European Union\" tabindex=\"0\">EU</abbr>-average was 87.9&nbsp;% in the respective year. The highest debt-to-<abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\" tabindex=\"0\">GDP</abbr> ratio were measured for Greece (194.5&nbsp;%) and Italy (150.3&nbsp;%); the lowest for Estonia (17.6&nbsp;%).<br><br>Consolidated debt of the state steadily increased since 1991, however, it reduced in 2013&nbsp;for the first time and constantly decreased from 2015&nbsp;on. In 2019, the consolidated debt of the overall public budget was 2,047&nbsp;billion euros. In consequence of the <abbr title=\"Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2\" tabindex=\"0\">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;pandemic, the consolidated debt increased to 2,472&nbsp;billion euros in 2021&nbsp;and, thus, reached its peak since 1991. Germany\u2019s debt per capita increased in 2021&nbsp;to 29,708&nbsp;euros; in 1991, the value was at 7,730&nbsp;euros.<br><br>Non-consolidated debt amounted to 2,486&nbsp;billion euros in 2021. Of the total amount of government debt in the respective year, about 67.0&nbsp;% was federal debt, while some 26.7&nbsp;% was owed by the L\u00e4nder and 6.3&nbsp;% by local government. The debt of the social insurance amounted to 392&nbsp;million euros (0.0&nbsp;%).<br><br>In the national balance of assets, the government debt is balanced by its assets&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;both tangible and financial. According to the national wealth accounts compiled by the Federal Statistical Office, fixed assets were valued (after amortisation) at 1,509&nbsp;billion euros in 2020. The biggest asset owned by the government is its buildings and structures (roads, schools, public buildings) at a value of 1,284&nbsp;billion euros, accounting for more than a third of the total assets of the state (34.4&nbsp;%). The financial assets were valued at 1,555&nbsp;billion euros (2020). Among them, securities represent the most highly valued asset (52.0&nbsp;%).","embedded_feature_html":"<p>Additional data series for the indicator can be found <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/AddInfos/en/8_2_c.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" >here</a>.</p><br><small>Note: You can display the PDF document directly in your browser or download the PDF document and open it with a PDF reader of your choice.

In addition to tertiary degrees from universities, universities of applied sciences, colleges of public administration, vocational and specialised academies as well as master craftsmen\u2019s and technicians\u2019 certificates, there are post-secondary non-tertiary degrees at upper secondary level which are obtained in parallel or consecutively. These include, for example, the \u201cAbitur\u201d (higher education entrance qualification) at evening schools or at two-year full-time vocational schools, the completion of vocational training after the \u201cAbitur\u201d or a previous vocational training.<br><br>The \u201cInternational Standard Classification of Education (<abbr title=\"International Standard Classification of Education\" tabindex=\"0\">ISCED</abbr>)\u201d enables international comparisons of statistics and indicators regarding certificates of education. Certificates that are regarded as equivalent are assigned to the same <abbr title=\"International Standard Classification of Education\" tabindex=\"0\">ISCED</abbr> levels. Therefore, the indicator includes both the tertiary degrees corresponding to levels 5&nbsp;to 8&nbsp;of the <abbr title=\"International Standard Classification of Education\" tabindex=\"0\">ISCED</abbr> as well as the post-secondary non-tertiary degrees corresponding to level 4&nbsp;of the <abbr title=\"International Standard Classification of Education\" tabindex=\"0\">ISCED</abbr>.<br><br>The data for the indicator originate from the microcensus, whose annual sample survey covers 1&nbsp;% of the population. The statistics of higher education provides supplementary information and is also compiled by the Federal Statistical Office.<br><br>Starting at 33.4&nbsp;% in 1999, the indicator increased by 19.9&nbsp;percentage points to 53.2&nbsp;% in 2021. If the average growth rate of the last five reference years is maintained, the target value of 55&nbsp;% could be achieved considerably earlier than 2030. The relation between the gender-specific percentages has changed over time. In 1999, the indicator for men was 3.8&nbsp;percentage points higher than for women. In 2006, the values were the same for both sexes. Since 2007, the percentage of women with a tertiary or post-secondary non-tertiary qualification has been higher than that of men and exceeded the target value for 2030&nbsp;already in year 2021&nbsp;(57.2&nbsp;%), while the proportion of men, which was 49.6&nbsp;% in 2021, would reach the target a good bit later.<br><br>Many other countries do not offer post-secondary non-tertiary education programmes. Therefore, the European version of the indicator from the \u201cEurope 2020\u201d strategy is more narrowly defined and takes only tertiary degrees (<abbr title=\"International Standard Classification of Education\" tabindex=\"0\">ISCED</abbr> levels 5-8) into account.<br><br>Following a steady increase since 2005, the European indicator reached a total of 41.6&nbsp;% across the <abbr title=\"European Union consisting of 27&nbsp;member states (without United Kingdom)\" tabindex=\"0\">EU-27</abbr>&nbsp;states in 2021. If one also uses this more narrowly defined indicator for Germany, the value of 37.8&nbsp;% obtained for 2021&nbsp;was more than 3.8&nbsp;percentage points below the <abbr title=\"European Union\" tabindex=\"0\">EU</abbr> value. Furthermore, in 2021, the proportion of women (38.6&nbsp;%) was higher than that of men (37.0&nbsp;%).<br><br>The number of university graduates in Germany totalled 517,944&nbsp;in 2021. This was more than twice as many as in 1999.

The surveys initially took place at intervals of three to four years, but since 2001&nbsp;they have been conducted almost every year. In order to ensure that the data are comparable over time, they are weighted on the basis of gender, region and age. The data for years without surveys have been interpolated for inclusion in the time series. The random sample used in 2021&nbsp;comprised 7,002&nbsp;adolescents.<br><br>The data for adults is collected every four years as part of the microcensus conducted by the Federal Statistical Office. The microcensus is a sample survey covering 1&nbsp;% of the total population and it is the largest household survey in Germany and Europe. The responses to the questions regarding smoking habits are voluntary and were provided by 65&nbsp;% of those surveyed in 2021. The interim years without a survey were interpolated for the presentation of the indicator time series.<br><br>In the group of adolescents between 12&nbsp;and 17&nbsp;years of age, the proportion of smokers initially increased from 22.5&nbsp;% (2003) to 23.5&nbsp;% (2004), but then declined steadily to 6.1&nbsp;% ((6.8&nbsp;% for adolescent girls, 5.5&nbsp;% of adolescent boys) by 2021. Therefore, the target value set for 2030&nbsp;is already achieved.<br><br>In 2021, a total of 18.9&nbsp;% of the overall population above the age of 15&nbsp;indicated that they smoked occasionally or regularly. This compares with a figure of 27.4&nbsp;% in year 2003. This means that the rate of adult smokers had declined and the target value set for 2030&nbsp;is achieved in 2021&nbsp;for the first time.<br><br>In 2021, 14.6&nbsp;% of all adults aged 15&nbsp;years or older considered themselves regular smokers, while 4.4&nbsp;% smoked occasionally. In contrast to adolescents, the rate of smokers among women (15.7&nbsp;%) was significantly lower than for men (22.3&nbsp;%). While the proportion of women decreased by 6.4&nbsp;percentage points since 2003, the proportion of male smokers decreased by 10.9&nbsp;percentage points.<br><br>In 2017, 96.2&nbsp;% of the smokers surveyed preferred cigarettes. The level of tobacco consumption is important when considering the individual threat to health. 10.8&nbsp;% of regular cigarette smokers were in the category of heavy smokers (2003: 16.3&nbsp;%) with a consumption of more than 20&nbsp;cigarettes a day, whereas 81.4&nbsp;% smoked 5&nbsp;to 20&nbsp;cigarettes a day. In this case, there were differences between the genders. Almost one in eight of male regular cigarette smokers was a heavy smoker, but only one in fourteen of the female smokers.<br><br>Smoking poses a high and at the same time avoidable risk to health. In 2020, 4.7&nbsp;% of all deaths (3.5&nbsp;% among women, 5.8&nbsp;% among men) could be attributed to typical diseases of smokers (lung, bronchial, laryngeal and tracheal cancer). In 2020, the average age of those who died of lung, bronchial, and tracheal cancers was 71.6&nbsp;years, that is, seven years below the average age of all deaths (78.8&nbsp;years). A reduction in the number of smokers would therefore help reduce premature mortality.","embedded_feature_html":"<p>Additional data series for the indicator can be found <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/AddInfos/en/3_1_cd.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" >here</a>.</p><br><small>Note: You can display the PDF document directly in your browser or download the PDF document and open it with a PDF reader of your choice.

These statistics are generally derived from a complete count with an obligation to provide information. The Federal Statistical Office combines them to create a federal result based on the catalogue of definitions compiled by the Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education. The aggregation of the L\u00e4nder results into the federal result is influenced by the different education policies of the L\u00e4nder, for example, with regard to admission rules, in setting up courses of education in the area of vocational schools. This can only be partially offset by formal regulations for the respective allocations.<br><br>Graduates are pupils who have left the respective type of school with a school certificate.

This also includes persons who are stateless and persons with undetermined citizenship.

The proportion of German school leavers obtaining at least a lower secondary school leaving certificate has remained fairly stable, most recently recorded as 94.9&nbsp;%. The gap between the share of foreign and German pupils graduating from school was at 6.1&nbsp;percentage points on the lowest level in 2013, however, the migration of refugees in 2015/2016&nbsp;caused a significant increase and even exceeded the value 20&nbsp;years ago (11.9&nbsp;percentage points in 1996&nbsp;and 13.0&nbsp;percentage points in 2017).

Like nitrogen, phosphorus also leads to eutrophication. Phosphorus pollution in rivers is examined separately in indicator 6.1.a.<br><br>The calculations for this indicator use monitoring data on nitrogen concentrations and on the discharge volumes of small and major rivers flowing into the North and Baltic Seas, which the German Environment Agency collates as reported by the L\u00e4nder and by river basin commissions. Data is also included for smaller rivers which do not flow directly into the North or Baltic Sea but are tributaries to larger rivers. In these cases, the data for each river are taken from its last monitoring site before the confluence. The Rhine is also included in the figures, even though its estuary is not in Germany. The data for the Rhine were recorded at the point where it leaves Germany (monitoring site at Bimmen, Kleve).<br><br>The nitrogen concentrations for each river are weighted for discharge volume, so that major rivers which discharge large qualities of water have a greater influence on the average that smaller ones. To prevent the graph being distorted by single extreme events like floods or droughts, which can result in anomalously very high or very low nitrogen inputs, the values are depicted as a five-year moving average.<br><br>The average nitrogen concentration for all North and Baltic Sea inflows, weighted for discharge volume, has followed a downward trend since the beginning of the time series, with the reduction in concentration more marked for the North Sea than the Baltic. The 2016-2020&nbsp;average for the North Sea inflows was a concentration of 2.8&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\" tabindex=\"0\">mg/l</abbr> and reached jointly the target value for the first time. For rivers flowing into the Baltic Sea, the average concentration was 3.1&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\" tabindex=\"0\">mg/l</abbr> for the same period and, thus, exceeded the upper limit of 2.6&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\" tabindex=\"0\">mg/l</abbr>.<br><br>In contrast to the aggregated indicator 14.1.a \u201cNitrogen inputs via the inflows into the North and Baltic Seas\u201d, each river by itself has to meet the management target to achieve good quality, as defined by the Ordinance on the Protection of Surface Waters. The target is neither achieved for the North Sea nor the Baltic Sea.<br><br>Of the three major inflows into the Baltic Sea, the Peene, the Trave and the Warnow, only the latter had already reached the management target by 2016-2020. Nevertheless, Peene and Trave showed a small reduction in concentration across the five-year averages by 0.1&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\" tabindex=\"0\">mg/l</abbr>. In some of the smaller Baltic Sea inflows, concentrations of nitrogen are still several times higher than the management target, with values of up to 5.9&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\" tabindex=\"0\">mg/l</abbr>, and the target was only reached by a quarter of the smaller Baltic Sea inflows.<br><br>Of the North Sea inflows, only the Rhine met the management target in the period 2016&nbsp;to 2020, and, hence, was mainly responsible for the joint achievement of the weighted for discharge volume target value. The five-year averages of nitrogen concentrations decreased for all major North Sea inflows (Ems, Weser, Rhein and Eider) by 0.1&nbsp;to 0.2&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\" tabindex=\"0\">mg/l</abbr>, except for the Elbe. A slight decline was also measured by the five-year averages of nitrogen concentrations for the small North Sea inflows. Accordingly, the values were between 2.6&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\" tabindex=\"0\">mg/l</abbr> and 3.5&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\" tabindex=\"0\">mg/l</abbr> in the period from 2016-2020.","embedded_feature_html":"<p>Additional data series for the indicator can be found <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/AddInfos/en/14_1_a.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" >here</a>.</p><br><small>Note: You can display the PDF document directly in your browser or download the PDF document and open it with a PDF reader of your choice.

The individual rates of change of the single air pollutants are offset equally against one another, even if the causes and the consequences differ. Thus, this indicator is mere indirectly dependent on the fulfilment of emission reduction targets set by the European Union. Hence, the reduction targets for the indicator might be met, while emission reduction targets for individual air pollutants are missed.<br><br>The data is computed annually by the German Environment Agency using various sources. They serve as a basis for the reporting obligation pursuant to the Geneva Convention and the National Emission Ceilings Directive. The data is further processed within the context of the Federal Statistical Office\u2019s Environmental-Economic Accounts. As a result, emissions are published according to various production sectors and households along with other emitters.<br><br>Emissions of air pollutants overall fell by 34.8&nbsp;% until 2020&nbsp;from 2005. The indicator thus moved in the intended direction and will reach the target for 2030&nbsp;if the development remains the same. Emissions of individual pollutants changed to varying degrees in the period from 2005&nbsp;to 2020. Based on the development of the preceding years, compliance with the emission reduction targets by 2030&nbsp;is feasible, to which Germany is committed towards the <abbr title=\"European Union\" tabindex=\"0\">EU</abbr>. In fact, Germany might reach the target for every single air pollutant.<br><br>Emissions of volatile organic compounds (<abbr title=\"non-methane volatile organic compounds\" tabindex=\"0\">NMVOC</abbr>), which are primarily due to the industrial use of solvents, were significantly reduced by 30.4&nbsp;% during the specified period.<br><br>In the specified period emissions of particulate matter (<abbr title=\"Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 2.5&nbsp;micrometers)\" tabindex=\"0\">PM\u2082.\u2085</abbr>) have been reduced by 39.8&nbsp;%. At 26.9&nbsp;%, the largest proportion of <abbr title=\"Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 2.5&nbsp;micrometers)\" tabindex=\"0\">PM\u2082.\u2085</abbr> emissions originated from households and small consumers in 2020.

During the period under consideration from 2005&nbsp;to 2020, the decline adds up to 10.9&nbsp;%. However, ammonia emissions increased temporarily between 2005&nbsp;and 2018, such that the overall reductions are rather small. Agricultural land use, among others the output of fermentation residues after the fermentation of energy crops, mainly caused the temporary growth of emissions between 2005&nbsp;and 2018. Agricultural land use is responsible for about half of the ammonia emissions. Emissions from this source increased during the period from 2005&nbsp;to 2018&nbsp;and are decreasing since 2016.

Settlement land includes areas used for residential building, industry and commerce, public facilities, recreational amenities or cemeteries. It also covers land used for surface or sub-surface mining. However, mining land is not counted in the calculations for this indicator, as it ends up being reclaimed for other uses in the long term (<abbr title=\"for example (exempli gratia)\" tabindex=\"0\">e.g.</abbr> as renaturalised post-mining landscapes). Transport area is made up of four subcategories: road transport, rail, aviation and shipping. The indicator therefore refers not only to sealed areas but also to undeveloped and unsealed land. These include, for example, domestic gardens, parks and other green spaces. As calculated in the environmental economic accounts compiled by the L\u00e4nder, the sealed share of their settlement and transport area is estimated at 45&nbsp;% on average (2020).<br><br>The indicator is derived from the area survey by type of actual use (official land-use statistics), which in turn is based on data from the official land register maintained by the L\u00e4nder. Some areas of land have been reclassified in the official land register in recent years without any actual change in the way they are used. To balance out the effect this has on the statistics for any particular year, a four-year moving average is also shown, averaging out the year in question and the three preceding years. Moreover, the switch from the old to the new land-use classification system was completed in 2016, which affected the official land-use statistics such that the data for 2016&nbsp;are not directly comparable to those for previous years. It is for this reason that the overall indicator value for 2016&nbsp;is also not subdivided into types of settlement or transport use.<br><br>From 2000&nbsp;to 2020, 6,257&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Square kilometer\" tabindex=\"0\">km\u00b2</abbr> of land was converted into settlement and transport area. This is equivalent to more than twice the area of Saarland. The majority, 85&nbsp;%, was converted into settlement land, while 15&nbsp;% went to accommodate transport infrastructure.<br><br>The four-year moving average of previously undeveloped areas newly converted to settlement or transport area continuously decreased throughout the time series until 2019. This year, the four-year moving average was at 52&nbsp;hectares per day and increased to 54&nbsp;hectares per day in 2020. Considered for each reporting year separately, the value for new settlement or transport area was lowest in 2019, at 45&nbsp;hectares per day. The figure has risen again since then, to 58&nbsp;hectares per day in 2020.<br><br>In 2020, the area of settlement or transport use amounted to 50,196&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Square kilometer\" tabindex=\"0\">km\u00b2</abbr>, or 14&nbsp;% of the total area of Germany. The largest land types in Germany are agricultural land at 180,934&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Square kilometer\" tabindex=\"0\">km\u00b2</abbr> (51&nbsp;%) followed by woodland at 106,666&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Square kilometer\" tabindex=\"0\">km\u00b2</abbr> (30&nbsp;%). Settlement and transport area grew by 942&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Square kilometer\" tabindex=\"0\">km\u00b2</abbr> between 2016&nbsp;and 2020. Agricultural land shrank by 1,703&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Square kilometer\" tabindex=\"0\">km\u00b2</abbr> during the same period, while woodland grew by 496&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Square kilometer\" tabindex=\"0\">km\u00b2</abbr>. It can therefore be assumed that the increase in settlement and transport area was primarily at the expense of agricultural land.","embedded_feature_html":"<p>Additional data series for the indicator can be found <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/AddInfos/en/11_1_a.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" >here</a>.</p><br><small>Note: You can display the PDF document directly in your browser or download the PDF document and open it with a PDF reader of your choice.

These statements include reporting on the main environmental impacts of the organisation in question as well as data pertaining to energy and material efficiency, emissions, water, waste and use of land/biodiversity. Organisations have to update their environmental statements annually, with the exception introduced in 2010&nbsp;that small and medium-sized enterprises can apply to do so every two years instead. The environmental statement, which is public, and various additional internal documents are inspected by independent, licensed environmental verifiers.

Survey results are derived from self-assessment of households. According to the definition of <abbr title=\"EU-Statistics on Income and Living Conditions\" tabindex=\"0\">EU-SILC</abbr>, households are characterized to suffer from (severe) material deprivation, if they fulfil at least three (severe material deprivation: at least four) of the following nine criteria:<br><br>   1.\tFinancial difficulties to pay for rent, mortgages, or utility bills on time.<br><br>   2.\tFinancial difficulties to ensure adequate heating in the residence.<br><br>   3.\tFinancial difficulties to meet unplanned expenditures of a specific amount from one\u2019s own financial resources.<br><br>   4.\tFinancial difficulties to eat meat, fish or an equivalent vegetarian meal every second day.<br><br>   5.\tFinancial difficulties to spend one week\u2019s holidays per year outside the actual residence.<br><br>   6.\tLack of a car in the household due to financial reasons.<br><br>   7.\tLack of a washing machine in the household due to financial reasons.<br><br>   8.\tLack of a colour TV in the household due to financial reasons. <br><br>   9.\tLack of a telephone in the household due to financial reasons.<br><br>Until 2019, the shares of the population experiencing both material deprivation and severe material deprivation declined over time for Germany as in the European Union (<abbr title=\"European Union\" tabindex=\"0\">EU</abbr>) as a whole.

If a household is receiving housing benefits or comparable social benefits, such as social-security payments for accommodation and heating, these are also included in the calculations. These social benefits are not added to the income amount but are deducted from the housing costs, so that the burden of housing expenses on households that rely on housing-related social benefits is reduced or almost nullified.<br><br>The purchase of an owner-occupied property is not included in the expenditure on housing. Other spending on measures to enhance the value of a property should not be taken into account either. However, it is not always possible to clearly differentiate between these and value-maintaining expenditures that are considered as housing expenditure. Therefore, some simplifying assumptions must be made. Moreover, the indicator also does not take into account any additional expenditure associated with the place of residence. For instance, expenditure on travelling from the place of residence to the workplace is not taken into account, although it is possible that the threshold of 40&nbsp;% is not reached only due to the fact that the place of residence is far away from work.<br><br>By defining the threshold value as \u201c40&nbsp;% of disposable household income\u201d, the indicator provides no information about average housing costs. If clusters emerge close to this threshold, they can cause major changes in the indicator over time even if there is only a small change in the ratio of income and housing expenditure.<br><br>The initial data for the indicator originate from the Europe-wide harmonised statistics on income and living conditions (<abbr title=\"EU-Statistics on Income and Living Conditions\" tabindex=\"0\">EU-SILC</abbr>). In survey year 2020, the data was integrated with extensive methodological changes as a subsample into the microcensus due to increasing requirements on data with respect to actuality and provision of more detailed regional results in survey year 2020. Thus, the results from 2020&nbsp;on are not comparable with previous years.<br><br>Overall, the indicator developed in the direction of the target value at 13&nbsp;% until 2019: after an initial growth, the indicator declined from 14.5&nbsp;% in 2010&nbsp;to 13.9&nbsp;% in 2019.

However, the comparison with results before 2020&nbsp;is due to the already mentioned extensive methodological changes in data collection and processing unfeasible.<br><br>With regard to the actual housing situation and disposable income, the indicator provides only a limited amount of meaningful information. After all, the calculation method means that households with high incomes and high expenditure on housing also appear to be overburdened.

Some 42.2&nbsp;% of people at risk of poverty were overburdened by housing costs in 2010, rising to 48.3&nbsp;% by 2019. In total, the values are on a high level. In contrast, excessive housing costs affected a markedly smaller proportion of people considered not at risk of poverty.

Switching to renewable energies (natural energy sources that constantly regenerate) serves to reduce energy-related emissions and hence the extent of climate change.

For this reason, the goal of the Federal Government is to increase the share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption to 18&nbsp;% by 2020, to 30&nbsp;% by 2030, to 45&nbsp;% by 2040&nbsp;and to 60&nbsp;% by 2050.","data_state":"The data published in the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/assets/Publikationen/Indikatorenberichte/2022.pdf\">indicator report 2022</a> is as of 31 October 2022.

Besides renewables, these sources also include imported electricity and fossil fuels such as coal and lignite, oil and gas.<br><br>The indicator is calculated by <abbr title=\"Working Group on Renewable Energy Statistics\" tabindex=\"0\">AGEE-Stat</abbr>, the Working Group on Renewable Energy Statistics. In contrast to the reporting under the Renewable Energy Directive of the European Union (Directive 2009/28/EC), uses an average value for hydro and wind power over several years to smoothen the effects of varying supply, this indicator takes account of the volumes of electricity actually generated from wind and hydro power (German Government Energy Concept).<br><br>With regard to the method used to calculate the indicator, it should be noted that imports and exports of electricity are not included in full in the consumption of energy from renewable sources, whereas they are factored into gross final energy consumption. Accordingly, the indicator may overstate or understate the ratio of energy from renewable sources to gross final energy consumption, depending on the balance of trade. If there were an export surplus for electricity&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;as has been the case since 2001&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;the actual percentage of renewables in the energy mix would be lower than the level represented by the indicator.<br><br>The intended share of renewable energies in gross final energy consumption for 2020&nbsp;was achieved by 19.7&nbsp;%. Thus, the target value of 18&nbsp;% by 2020&nbsp;was exceeded. In 2021, the share of renewable energies decreased to 19.2&nbsp;% and is not heading towards the upcoming target value of 30&nbsp;% by 2030. However, the indicator shows a significant increase long-term (2005: 7.1&nbsp;%).<br><br>The use of renewables varies widely between sectors. In 2021, the share accounted for 41.1&nbsp;% of gross electricity generation, 16.5&nbsp;% of final energy consumption for heating and cooling and 6.8&nbsp;% in the transport sector. Among renewable energies, biomass, with a share of 58.0&nbsp;% and wind power, which accounts for 24.0&nbsp;%, play the greatest part in primary energy consumption in 2020&nbsp;(more recent data was not available at the time of going to press).<br><br>The indicator has cross-references to indicators 3.2.a \u201cEmissions of air pollutants\u201d, 7.2.b \u201cShare of electricity from renewable sources in gross electricity consumption\u201d and 13.1.a \u201cGreenhouse gas emissions\u201d.","embedded_feature_html":"<p>Additional data series for the indicator can be found <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/AddInfos/en/7_2_a.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" >here</a>.</p><br><small>Note: You can display the PDF document directly in your browser or download the PDF document and open it with a PDF reader of your choice.

The data shown on this platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/assets/Publikationen/Indikatorenberichte/2022.pdf\">indicator report 2022</a>.","indicator_name":"Loss of open space area","section":"Land use","postulate":"Using land sustainably","target_id":"11.1.1","previous":"11-1-a","next":"11-1-c","content_and_progress":"<b>Text from the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/assets/Publikationen/Indikatorenberichte/2022.pdf\">Indicator Report 2022&nbsp;</a></b><br><br>Open space area includes areas of vegetation, such as arable land, pasture and woodland, as well as mining land and bodies of water. A distinction is made between open space proper and open areas within settlement zones, such as cemeteries, gardens, parks and recreational amenities, which, although largely undeveloped, are generally considered part of settlement and transport area. As a result, if previously undeveloped parts of settlement land are built on, this is neither reflected in this indicator 11.1.b \u201cLoss of open space area\u201d nor in the indicator 11.1.a \u201cExpansion of settlement and transport area\u201d.<br><br>In the period under review, the national average for per capita loss of open space area went down. Whereas the four-year moving average for 2001-2004&nbsp;was still around 5&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Square meter\" tabindex=\"0\">m\u00b2</abbr> per capita, the current four-year moving average for 2017-2020&nbsp;reveals a figure of just 3&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Square meter\" tabindex=\"0\">m\u00b2</abbr>.<br><br>Although subject to a similar trend, significant differences can be observed between rural and non-rural areas in terms of the degree of change. The loss of per capita open space area per inhabitant in rural areas contracted from 7.4&nbsp;to 4.5&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Square meter\" tabindex=\"0\">m\u00b2</abbr> per year. In non-rural areas, it fell from 1.8&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Square meter\" tabindex=\"0\">m\u00b2</abbr> to 0.7&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Square meter\" tabindex=\"0\">m\u00b2</abbr>. In this context, it important to remember that non-rural districts and district-free cities have much less open space, such as forest or farmland, than rural areas do. Demographic trends also differ, and the indicator reflects those disparities, with rural areas mostly seeing their populations shrink during the period under review, while population numbers in non-rural areas rose slightly overall.<br><br>The data sources for the indicator are the population figures and the area survey by type of actual use compiled by the Federal Statistical Office. Since population data at regional level are used for the associated calculations, the 2011&nbsp;census caused a jump in the time series. Moreover, some areas of land have been reclassified in the official land register maintained by the L\u00e4nder in recent years, without any actual change to the landscape. To smooth out these effects and depict the long-term trend, a four-year moving average is shown, averaging out the figures for each year with those for the three preceding years. Additionally, the switch from the old to the new land use classification system was completed in 2016, which affected the official land-use statistics such that the data for 2016&nbsp;are not directly comparable to those for previous years. This is why the development of the indicator for 2016&nbsp;is only shown as a broken outline in the graph.<br><br>The distinction between rural and non-rural is based on a classification used by the Th\u00fcnen Institute. The institute ascribes a degree of rurality to districts and district-free cities on the basis of geographical characteristics such as settlement density and share of farmland and woodland. The classification is thus applied to whole districts rather than to smaller entities like towns or villages.","embedded_feature_html":"<p>Additional data series for the indicator can be found <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/AddInfos/en/11_1_b.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" >here</a>.</p><br><small>Note: You can display the PDF document directly in your browser or download the PDF document and open it with a PDF reader of your choice.

The monitoring points used for this purpose are combined in the \u201cEEA monitoring network\u201d. The <abbr title=\"European Environment Agency\" tabindex=\"0\">EEA</abbr> monitoring network comprises a total of 1,214&nbsp;monitoring sites and provides a representative picture of Germany. The data are summarised by the German Environment Agency based on information from the German Working Group on Water Issues of the L\u00e4nder and the Federal Government represented by the Federal Environment Ministry (<abbr title=\"German Working Group on Water Issues of the L\u00e4nder and the Federal Government\" tabindex=\"0\">LAWA</abbr>).<br><br>Like the indicator of phosphorus content in flowing waters, the nitrate indicator does not reveal how far above or below the threshold the readings have been. The indicator merely records how many of all the monitoring sites complied with the prescribed threshold. The nitrate load may have fallen sharply at some monitoring sites. Nevertheless, if the concentration remains above the maximum of 50&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\" tabindex=\"0\">mg/l</abbr>, the reduction will not be reflected in the indicator. The same applies to nitrate loads that have increased but are still below the threshold. The interpretation must also take into account that measures to reduce nitrate pollution may have a delayed effect, since the period of infiltration from the surface to the groundwater can take several years.<br><br>The naturally occurring level of nitrate lies between 0&nbsp;and 10&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\" tabindex=\"0\">mg/l</abbr>. Concentrations between 10&nbsp;and 25&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\" tabindex=\"0\">mg/l</abbr> indicate minor to medium loads. Concentrations between 25&nbsp;and 50&nbsp;milligrams per liter indicate severe groundwater contamination. Figures above the threshold of 50&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\" tabindex=\"0\">mg/l</abbr> which is set in the Ground Water Ordinance and which also underlies this indicator mean that the groundwater has a poor chemical status and cannot be used as drinking water without treatment.<br><br>In 2020&nbsp;the target of less than 50&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams\" tabindex=\"0\">mg</abbr> of nitrate per litre was met at 84.1&nbsp;% of all monitoring sites. Since 2008, the percentage of monitoring sites at which this target is met has remained virtually unchanged. This means that the goal of recording concentrations below the threshold at all monitoring sites has not been achieved and that the indicator value is not recognisably moving in that direction. Conversely, in 2020&nbsp;the nitrate threshold of 50&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\" tabindex=\"0\">mg/l</abbr> was exceeded at 15.9&nbsp;% of the groundwater monitoring sites in the <abbr title=\"European Environment Agency\" tabindex=\"0\">EEA</abbr> monitoring network. At 17.8&nbsp;% of the monitoring sites the nitrate value lay between 25&nbsp;and 50&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\" tabindex=\"0\">mg/l</abbr>, which still indicates an elevated degree of pollution. This percentage rate also remained virtually unchanged over the years.<br><br>The pollution of groundwater with nitrate is caused primarily by the leaching of nitrate from various nitrogen fertilisers. Besides farmyard manures such as liquid manure and slurry, these also include the mineral fertilisers that are used in intensive crop-farming. The last few years have also seen an increase in the use of digestate, which occurs as a by-product of biogas power plants, as an agricultural fertiliser. All of these things can contribute to higher nitrate values in groundwater if fertilisation is not matched to specific crop requirements. Accordingly, the development of indicator 2.1.a \u201cNitrogen surplus in agriculture\u201d influences the nitrate load in groundwater.<br><br>In order to measure the actual influence of agricultural activity on the nitrate load of waters, there is a separate system of nitrate reporting to the <abbr title=\"European Union\" tabindex=\"0\">EU</abbr>. For this report, the monitoring sites for waters in predominantly agricultural catchment areas are selected from the <abbr title=\"European Environment Agency\" tabindex=\"0\">EEA</abbr> site network. The nitrate load in that specific part of the monitoring network is therefore above the average for indicator 6.1.b.","embedded_feature_html":"<p>Additional data series for the indicator can be found <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/AddInfos/en/6_1_b.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" >here</a>.</p><br><small>Note: You can display the PDF document directly in your browser or download the PDF document and open it with a PDF reader of your choice.

To calculate the number of criminal offences per 100,000&nbsp;inhabitants, (extrapolated) population figures based on the 2011&nbsp;census are used for the entire time series. This methodology allows comparisons over time to be made from 1993&nbsp;onwards. It should be noted that this results in discrepancies in relation to the Police Crime Statistics data published prior to 2013.<br><br>Changes in the Police Crime Statistics do not always reflect actual changes, as the statistics cover only that proportion of criminal activity that officially comes to the attention of the police. Since there is no statistical data on offences which go unreported, such crimes cannot be reflected in the Police Crime Statistics. However, the proportion of reported versus unreported crime was investigated in 2012&nbsp;and 2017&nbsp;by means of the German Victim Survey. For the offences dealt with in the survey, no statistically significant change in reporting rates was found between 2012&nbsp;and 2017.<br><br>The number of offences was 6,070&nbsp;per 100,000&nbsp;inhabitants in 2021. Thus, the target value for 2030&nbsp;of less than 6,500&nbsp;criminal offences was achieved ahead of time for the second time in a row. The indicator fell by 27.3&nbsp;% between 1993&nbsp;and 2021. This trajectory, however, has not been continuous. For instance, it increased from 2000&nbsp;to 2004, before entering a slight decline which continued until 2010. The large number of people who entered Germany as refugees and asylum-seekers from 2015&nbsp;on is also reflected in the Police Crime Statistics, with violation of the legislation concerning foreigners (<abbr title=\"for example (exempli gratia)\" tabindex=\"0\">e.g.</abbr> illegal entry) soaring by 211.8&nbsp;% in 2016&nbsp;compared with 2014. Such offences had fallen drastically by 2021, though, when they made up only 2.9&nbsp;% of all criminal offences. Even when violations of the legislation concerning foreigners are accounted for, the total number of criminal offences registered by the police was lower in 2021&nbsp;than in previous years (5.0&nbsp;million).<br><br>In 2021, domestic burglaries accounted for 1.1&nbsp;%, fraud for 15.7&nbsp;%, and dangerous and serious bodily injury for 2.4&nbsp;%. Between 2016&nbsp;and 2021, the incidence of domestic burglary fell by 64.1&nbsp;%, fraud fell by 11.7&nbsp;% and cases of dangerous and serious bodily injury fell by 12.6&nbsp;%.<br><br>The success rate for solving cases was 58.7&nbsp;% of all offences registered by the police in 2021, roughly the same as in the previous year. There were significant differences, however, depending on the type of criminal offence. For domestic burglary, for example, the rate of cases solved was only 19.5&nbsp;%. By contrast, 63.3&nbsp;% of fraud offences and 83.9&nbsp;% of cases of serious and grievous bodily harm cases were cleared up. The comparatively low success rate for domestic burglary is related to a high rate of reporting combined with the comparatively infrequent existence of solid leads pointing to the perpetrators.

Whether a flow is counted as <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\" tabindex=\"0\">ODA</abbr> is determined by guidelines issued by the <abbr title=\"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\" tabindex=\"0\">OECD</abbr> Development Assistance Committee (<abbr title=\"Development Assistance Committee\" tabindex=\"0\">DAC</abbr>). <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\" tabindex=\"0\">ODA</abbr> comprises public funds spent in order to advance the economic and social development of developing countries. It primarily includes expenditure for financial and technical cooperation with developing countries, humanitarian aid and development-cooperation contributions to multilateral institutions such as the United Nations, the European Union, the World Bank or regional development banks. Under certain conditions, spending on peace missions, debt relief and certain items of development expenditure in the donor country&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;such as tuition costs for students from developing countries, domestic spending on refugees and funding for development-related research&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;can also be counted as <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\" tabindex=\"0\">ODA</abbr>. The <abbr title=\"Development Assistance Committee\" tabindex=\"0\">DAC</abbr> also defines the list of developing countries eligible for <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\" tabindex=\"0\">ODA</abbr>. This includes the least developed countries (<abbr title=\"Least developed countries\" tabindex=\"0\">LDCs</abbr>) as well as other countries with low and medium per capita <abbr title=\"Gross national income\" tabindex=\"0\">GNI</abbr>. The list is consistently updated, such that changes in the indicator may therefore be the result of one or more countries being added to or removed from the list.<br><br>In 2018, there was a change in the way <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\" tabindex=\"0\">ODA</abbr> loans (<abbr title=\"that is to say (id est)\" tabindex=\"0\">i.e.</abbr> loans, bonds and debt reliefs) are evaluated, in that the previous net-flows principle was replaced by the grant-equivalent method. In this method, only the grant element of an <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\" tabindex=\"0\">ODA</abbr> loan is determined by the interest rate and duration, among others, and is counted as <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\" tabindex=\"0\">ODA</abbr>. The intention behind the new methodology is to make <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\" tabindex=\"0\">ODA</abbr> grants and <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\" tabindex=\"0\">ODA</abbr> loans comparable.<br><br>As calculated using the new method, Germany\u2019s <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\" tabindex=\"0\">ODA</abbr> came to 27.3&nbsp;billion euros (provisional results) in 2021, slightly higher than the 25.2&nbsp;billion euros recorded for 2020. <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\" tabindex=\"0\">ODA</abbr> in 2021&nbsp;accounted for 0.74&nbsp;% of Germany\u2019s <abbr title=\"Gross national income\" tabindex=\"0\">GNI</abbr> (2020: 0.73&nbsp;%). Hence, the target of 0.70&nbsp;% was reached in 2020&nbsp;and 2021. For comparison, net <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\" tabindex=\"0\">ODA</abbr> spending (using the evaluation method that was standard until 2017) came to around 26.6&nbsp;billion euros in 2021. While the <abbr title=\"Gross national income\" tabindex=\"0\">GNI</abbr> increased by a factor of 1.5&nbsp;compared to 2010, net <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\" tabindex=\"0\">ODA</abbr> trebled in the same period.<br><br>On the international scale, in 2021&nbsp;Germany was once again the second-largest contributor in absolute terms, after the United States and ahead of Japan (provisional figures). However, the <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\" tabindex=\"0\">ODA</abbr>-ratio for the United States was at 0.18&nbsp;% below the average of the <abbr title=\"Development Assistance Committee\" tabindex=\"0\">DAC</abbr> countries (0.33&nbsp;%). Germany had the fourth-highest ODA:GNI ratio among the 29&nbsp;members of the <abbr title=\"Development Assistance Committee\" tabindex=\"0\">DAC</abbr>. According to the provisional figures for 2021, the international target of 0.70&nbsp;% was met by four <abbr title=\"Development Assistance Committee\" tabindex=\"0\">DAC</abbr> countries: Luxembourg (0.99&nbsp;%), Norway (0.93&nbsp;%), Sweden (0.92&nbsp;%), and Denmark (0.70&nbsp;%).<br><br>In addition to official development cooperation, private funds are also provided by such organisations as churches, foundations and associations. These chiefly take the form of contributions and donations. This private development cooperation, which does not affect the <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\" tabindex=\"0\">ODA</abbr> figures, amounted to 1.3&nbsp;billion euros in 2020, the equivalent of a 0.04&nbsp;% share of <abbr title=\"Gross national income\" tabindex=\"0\">GNI</abbr>.

This indicator reflects three of the factors behind this impact, namely energy consumption, <abbr title=\"Carbon dioxide\" tabindex=\"0\">CO\u2082</abbr> emissions and the use of raw materials for Germany and foreign countries. The relevant data are collated in the environmental economic accounts of a range of governmental and non-governmental sources.<br><br>Resources may be consumed by households directly or indirectly. Direct consumption might be the use of gas for heating, fuel for transport or food to eat. Resources are also tied up or consumed at every stage of the process of manufacturing and transporting consumer goods both within Germany and abroad. All of that counts as indirect consumption by German private households when they buy and use those goods. Both types of consumption are included in the present indicator, the environmental impact represented in terms of energy, raw materials and <abbr title=\"Carbon dioxide\" tabindex=\"0\">CO\u2082</abbr>.<br><br>The use of raw materials, energy consumption and <abbr title=\"Carbon dioxide\" tabindex=\"0\">CO\u2082</abbr> emissions are closely interconnected. To use coal, oil and gas&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;material resources&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;in power plants and boilers to produce electricity and heat is simultaneously to consume energy. As a rule, the burning of fuels also results in the emission of <abbr title=\"Carbon dioxide\" tabindex=\"0\">CO\u2082</abbr>.<br><br>However, the use of raw materials is not restricted to fuels. This is clear from the time series in the graph: while the data for energy consumption and emissions follow a fluctuating but generally downwards trend, the change in the use of raw materials is less marked. That factor is made up both of abiotic resources, which include other mineral resources like sand and salts as well as fuels, and of renewable resources like the products of farming and forestry. While the use of abiotic resources was decreasing until 2014&nbsp;and increasing from then on, there are contrary developments in the area of agricultural products. This resulted in a slight overall reduction of 2&nbsp;% between 2010&nbsp;and 2015. Although rising in 2016, the use of raw materials reached the level of 2010&nbsp;in the two subsequent years 2017&nbsp;and 2018.<br><br>In contrast, energy consumption went down by 6&nbsp;% during the period from 2010&nbsp;to 2017.<br><br>Energy loss incurred during the generation of electricity and district heat for consumption by private households is counted as indirect consumption. Energy consumption can be split according to the different fields in which it occurs, namely home life, transport, food, other products and services. At around 3,343&nbsp;petajoules in total, home life accounted for the largest proportion, 35&nbsp;% of private household consumption, in 2017.<br><br>A similar trend can be seen in <abbr title=\"Carbon dioxide\" tabindex=\"0\">CO\u2082</abbr> emissions. The vast majority of emissions are generated indirectly, during the manufacturing process of consumer goods in Germany and abroad, rather than during the actual consumption of the goods. The total <abbr title=\"Carbon dioxide\" tabindex=\"0\">CO\u2082</abbr> emissions caused by private household consumption in 2017&nbsp;amounted to 678&nbsp;million tonnes. The ratio of direct to indirect emissions was around 1:2. Between 2010&nbsp;and 2017, direct <abbr title=\"Carbon dioxide\" tabindex=\"0\">CO\u2082</abbr> emissions fell by 6&nbsp;%, while the emissions footprint of consumer goods fell by 9&nbsp;%. In total, the direct and indirect <abbr title=\"Carbon dioxide\" tabindex=\"0\">CO\u2082</abbr> emissions caused by private household consumption decreased by 8&nbsp;%.<br><br>This indicator can be usefully cross-referenced with indicator 8.1&nbsp;on \u201craw material input productivity\u201d.","embedded_feature_html":"<p>Additional data series for the indicator can be found <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/AddInfos/en/12_1_b.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" >here</a>.</p><br><small>Note: You can display the PDF document directly in your browser or download the PDF document and open it with a PDF reader of your choice.

Public means of transport are defined as transport services that anyone can use on payment of the relevant fees. Flexible forms of operation, such as on-call buses that operate on demand without fixed stopping points and timetables, are not taken into account.<br><br>Comparing the indicator values for 2012&nbsp;and 2020&nbsp;shows that the population-weighted average travel time to the nearest medium-sized or major city fell from 23.5&nbsp;to 20.6&nbsp;minutes during that period. This equates to a reduction of 12.3&nbsp;%.<br><br>However, the number of medium-sized and major cities grew from 1,010&nbsp;in 2012&nbsp;to 1,112&nbsp;in 2020. Much of this growth can be traced to the designation of additional urban centres as medium-sized cities in Bavaria. It is beyond the purview of this report to assess whether that change of status reflects an actual improvement in the provision available in those cities. Nonetheless, the increase in medium-sized and major cities notably helped reduce the average travel time required to reach one. If the average travel time for each reporting year is calculated on the basis of only those intermediate and major cities which existed in 2012, it is found to have decreased from 23.5&nbsp;minutes in 2012&nbsp;to 21.3&nbsp;minutes in 2020. This equates to a reduction in travel time of only 9.4&nbsp;% in relation to 2012.<br><br>The data for these calculations were taken from the timetables of Deutsche Bahn, various networks and numerous other transport providers. With the help of the timetable data, the travel times to the nearest intermediate or major city during peak morning traffic times were determined for about 260,000&nbsp;stops. This period is defined differently across the reporting years. Whereas connections with arrival times between 6&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Before noon (ante meridiem)\" tabindex=\"0\">a.m.</abbr> and 9&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Before noon (ante meridiem)\" tabindex=\"0\">a.m.</abbr> were taken into account in 2012, the figures for 2016&nbsp;and 2018&nbsp;refer to connections with arrival times between 8&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Before noon (ante meridiem)\" tabindex=\"0\">a.m.</abbr> and 12&nbsp;noon. For 2020, the arrival time was expanded to a period from 6&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Before noon (ante meridiem)\" tabindex=\"0\">a.m.</abbr> to 12&nbsp;noon.<br><br>Not least because not all local transport schedules had been fully incorporated into the database used, the values for the different reporting years cannot be compared without caveats. Moreover, the indicator provides information about the scheduled travel time to the next centre and does not account for delays or cancellations in its calculations. Therefore, the frequency of transport services to the nearest intermediate or major city is ignored, as is travel time to and from the stopping point. Furthermore, this indicator is based on timetable data&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;which means that delays or even cancellations are not taken into account.<br><br>The classification of an urban centre as a medium-size or large city is determined according to the availability of goods, services and infrastructure that are not available in the surrounding regional towns. These include, among other things, specialist medical practices, hospitals, cultural facilities as well as secondary schools and institutions of higher education. In each intermediate or large city, especially in large cities, only one location in the city centre was designated as the destination. The destination stops were selected within a radius of one kilometre around that destination point, and the quickest connection from each departure stop to that point was sought. A population-weighted average value of the travel time for Germany was then determined with the help of small-scale population data from the Federal Statistical Office.","embedded_feature_html":"<p>Additional data series for the indicator can be found <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/AddInfos/en/11_2_c.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" >here</a>.</p><br><small>Note: You can display the PDF document directly in your browser or download the PDF document and open it with a PDF reader of your choice.

The calculation of this variable, referred to as imports in raw material equivalents, is based on a complex model that employs data from various official and unofficial sources.<br><br>Due to the monetary and physical inclusion of imports, the indicator takes into account the value added and raw material use across the entire production chain both inside and outside of Germany. In this way, the economic interdependence with foreign countries is also taken into account comprehensively. The raw material use mapped in the indicator covers not only domestic final use but also exports. It should therefore not be confused with a resource footprint for Germany.<br><br>The indicator includes not only the raw materials that were considered to be non-renewable, that is, mineral raw materials and fossile fuels, but also plant-based products from farming and forestry activities. This means that double counting occurs to a limited degree. For example, both the mass of an agricultural product at harvest time as well as that of the mineral fertiliser used to produce it are recorded.<br><br>The value of the indicator increased by 26&nbsp;% from 2000&nbsp;to 2018. This increase results in particular from the growth of the numerator: the value of the final use (domestic consumption and domestic investments as well as exports) increased by 46&nbsp;% during the reference period. The removal of domestic raw materials fell moderately between 2000&nbsp;and 2018; at the same time, however, the mass of imports in raw material equivalents increased, causing a slight increase of 16&nbsp;% in the indicator\u2019s denominator.<br><br>Domestically extracted raw materials as well as imports are also being exported (again) to an increasing degree. Consequently, the indicator\u2019s denominator does not point to increased global raw material extraction for consumption and investment in Germany, but reflects generally more intensive links between the German economy and the outside world.<br><br>The year 2009&nbsp;should be considered an outlier due to the exceptional economic situation in the European financial market and economic crisis. In 2010&nbsp;and 2011, investments and exports, as well as the associated input of raw materials, rose sharply again. This marked a resumption of the trend that had been seen in the period up to 2008. Although raw material input productivity slightly decreased or stagnated at some points in time, the general trend tended to improve. The indicator increased by 5&nbsp;percentage points in 2017&nbsp;compared to the preceding year, however, 2018&nbsp;recorded a slight decline by 1&nbsp;percentage point.

It covers the population living in private households, but does not include people living in collective accommodation. The economically active population covered by the labour force survey consists of persons aged 15&nbsp;and over who performed an activity for remuneration for at least one hour during the reference week or who worked as unpaid family workers. Also included are persons who temporarily did not work because they were absent, for example due to holidays or illness. It should be noted that there have been changes over time in the Labor Force Survey that affect the comparability of the time series presented over time (<abbr title=\"for example (exempli gratia)\" tabindex=\"0\">e.g.</abbr> adjustment to results of the 2011&nbsp;census, revision of the 2020&nbsp;Microcensus).<br><br>The total employment rate (20&nbsp;to 64-year-olds) rose by 10.9&nbsp;percentage points from 68.7&nbsp;% in 2000&nbsp;to 79.6&nbsp;% in 2021. Thus, the target value of 78.0&nbsp;% for 2030&nbsp;has already been achieved from 2015&nbsp;on. The employment rate among older people (60&nbsp;to 64-year-olds) rose by 41.5&nbsp;percentage points from 19.6&nbsp;% in 2000&nbsp;to 61.1&nbsp;% in 2021. The employment rate for men in that age group had more than doubled, rising by 38.5&nbsp;percentage points to 65.7&nbsp;%. The rate for women even increased almost fivefold from 12.1&nbsp;% to 56.7&nbsp;%. Hence, the targeted 60&nbsp;% employment rate for older people was likewise reached since 2018&nbsp;ahead of the deadline set in the German strategy for sustainable development.<br><br>The overall employment rates for women and men have developed in the same direction since 2000&nbsp;but at different rates. The rate for 20&nbsp;to 64-year-old men rose in the period under review by 6.7&nbsp;percentage points to 83.2&nbsp;%, whereas in the case of women it rose by 15.2&nbsp;percentage points to 75.9&nbsp;%, which was a far more rapid rise, albeit from a lower starting point. When assessing the increase in the employment rate for women, it should be taken into account that this growth was accompanied by an increase in part-time employment. In the year 2000, 61.5&nbsp;% of employed women worked full-time, while 38.5&nbsp;% worked part-time. In 2021, 52.3&nbsp;% and 47.7&nbsp;% of employed women worked full-time and part-time, respectively. By way of comparison, the proportion of the male workforce in full-time employment dropped from 95.7&nbsp;% in 2000&nbsp;to 89.8&nbsp;% in 2021.<br><br>A breakdown into age groups shows diverse employment rate trends. Among 20&nbsp;to 24-year-olds, the rate rose from 2000&nbsp;to 2021&nbsp;by 2.4&nbsp;percentage points to 67.2&nbsp;%. Among 25- to 59-year-olds, by contrast, the employment rate rose to 83.9&nbsp;%, an increase of 7.7&nbsp;percentage points. The lower employment rates of 20&nbsp;to 24&nbsp;year-olds is also related to the average duration of education at school and university, which postpones entry into working life.","embedded_feature_html":"<p>Additional data series for the indicator can be found <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/AddInfos/en/8_5_ab.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" >here</a>.</p><br><small>Note: You can display the PDF document directly in your browser or download the PDF document and open it with a PDF reader of your choice.

Under the bill for a Second Gender Equality (Management Positions) Act, which became effective on 21&nbsp;August 2021, equal representation of women and men in management positions in the civil service is to be achieved by 2025.","data_state":"The data published in the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/assets/Publikationen/Indikatorenberichte/2022.pdf\">indicator report 2022</a> is as of 31 October 2022. The data shown on this platform was last updated in November 2024.","indicator_name":"Women in management positions in business and in the federal civil service","section":"Equality","postulate":"Promoting equal opportunities in society","target_id":"5.1.1","previous":"5-1-a","next":"5-1-d","content_and_progress":"<b>Text from the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/assets/Publikationen/Indikatorenberichte/2022.pdf\">Indicator Report 2022&nbsp;</a></b><br><br><b><i>Percentage of women on supervisory boards of listed and fully co-determined companies</i></b><br><br>This indicator measures the proportion of women on the supervisory boards of listed companies and joint-stock companies with more than 2,000&nbsp;employees as well as European Companies (<abbr title=\"Societas Europaea\" tabindex=\"0\">SE</abbr>) and listed companies that are subject to equal co-determination. The data is based on publications of the results of elections at general meetings of shareholders of listed and fully co-determined companies, which are evaluated by the association \u201cFrauen in die Aufsichtsr\u00e4te\u201d (<abbr title=\"Frauen in die Aufsichtsr\u00e4te\" tabindex=\"0\">FidAR</abbr>) and published in the form of a Women on Board Index (<abbr title=\"Women on Board\" tabindex=\"0\">WOB</abbr>-Index).<br><br>In January 2022, the average proportion of women on the supervisory boards of these companies was 35.6&nbsp;% (January 2015: 21.3&nbsp;%). This means that the target share of 30&nbsp;% was already reached in 2018&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;twelve years before the deadline set in the German strategy for sustainable development. However, the share in 2022&nbsp;slightly decreased for the first time since 2015.<br><br>Provided that the companies complied with the law, this increase was to be expected as the \u201cAct on the Equal Participation of Women and Men in Executive Positions\u201d since 2016&nbsp;requires at least 30&nbsp;% of the supervisory board positions to be filled by women in all newly elected supervisory boards of the above-mentioned companies.<br><br>With regard to the results, it should also be noted that the majority of companies in Germany and most of the management positions in the economy are excluded by the underlying definition. On the one hand, the group of reporting entities currently comprises 101&nbsp;companies according to the definition. On the other hand, the roughly 1,600&nbsp;supervisory board positions considered by <abbr title=\"Frauen in die Aufsichtsr\u00e4te\" tabindex=\"0\">FidAR</abbr> to date represent only a small portion of management positions in the economy with its 882,000&nbsp;managers in 2018&nbsp;according to the structure of earnings survey (more recent data was not available at the time of going to press). These numbers illustrate that only part of the management positions in a company are considered when the coverage is limited to the supervisory bodies.<br><br>According to the International Standard Classification of Occupations (<abbr title=\"International Standard Classification of Occupations\" tabindex=\"0\">ISCO</abbr>), managers are all persons who plan, control, coordinate and evaluate the overall activities of companies, governments and other organisations or internal organisational units and who review and evaluate guidelines, laws, rules and regulations. This definition includes the activities of supervisory boards. When the <abbr title=\"International Standard Classification of Occupations\" tabindex=\"0\">ISCO</abbr> classification is applied, 22&nbsp;% of the 882,000&nbsp;management positions in the economy (all companies with more than one employee) were filled by women in 2018. This figure is reached by considering all businesses with at least one employee for whom compulsory social insurance contributions are payable, excluding entities in sector O \u201cPublic administration and defence; compulsory social security\u201d and parts of sector P \u201cEducation\u201d. Compared with 2014, the year of the previous structure of earnings survey, this represents an increase of 1.2&nbsp;percentage points.<br><br><b><i>Percentage of women in management positions in the federal civil service</i></b><br><br>The data basis for this indicator comprises the internal gender equality statistics collected by all offices of the federal government pursuant to the Federal Gender Equality Act. Since 2015, these statistics have been compiled every second year, updated to 30&nbsp;June of the reporting year, by the Federal Statistical Office on behalf of the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth. For improved transparency, the indicator will receive biannual data from extended monitoring by the measure IX 1.b by the German strategy for sustainable development and the second managements position act (<abbr title=\"F\u00fchrungspositionen-Gesetz\" tabindex=\"0\">F\u00fcPoG</abbr> II) provided by subordinated departments of the direct federal administration regarding the number of women and men in management positions. The indicator is focused on the employees in management positions in all departments of the Federal Government. Their number includes all persons employed on a full-time or part-time basis as well as those who have been given leave of absence on grounds of family or care responsibilities or have been entirely released from their normal duties. The departments of the federal civil service encompass the supreme federal authorities, the subordinate federal authorities and courts and the corporations, agencies and foundations established under federal public law.<br><br>The concept of management positions that is used in the federal gender equality statistics differs from the aforementioned <abbr title=\"International Standard Classification of Occupations\" tabindex=\"0\">ISCO</abbr> definition. There is therefore only limited scope for comparisons between the different statistics.<br><br>According to <abbr title=\"Paragraph\" tabindex=\"0\">\u00a7</abbr> 3&nbsp;of the gender equality statistics regulation (GleiStatV), managers have hitherto comprised those persons who have command and leadership duties in departments of the civil service. In the supreme federal authorities these are predominantly employees of the higher service (from head of section to State Secretary). Further, other departments of the central government are authorized to transfer leadership positions to employees in higher intermediate or intermediate services. In order to ensure a certain degree of consistency and to enable comparability of the data, only employees with supervisory and management duties in the higher service are recorded in the supreme federal authorities, irrespective of whether employees in the higher intermediate or intermediate services also perform such duties in these departments.<br><br>In 2021, the proportion of women in management positions in the federal civil service was about 39.6&nbsp;% (2000: 19.5&nbsp;%). Thus, the proportion of women has doubled in size since 2000. If the trend of the last five years were maintained, the target of virtual numerical equality in management positions in the federal civil service by 2025&nbsp;would be narrowly missed.","embedded_feature_html":"<p>Additional data series for the indicator can be found <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/AddInfos/en/5_1_bc.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" >here</a>.</p><br><small>Note: You can display the PDF document directly in your browser or download the PDF document and open it with a PDF reader of your choice.
