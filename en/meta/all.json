The data basis for the indicator comprises the publications of listed and fully co-determined companies, which are analysed by the Frauen in die Aufsichtsr\u00e4te (Women on Board) association and published in the form of a <abbr title=\"Women on Board\">WOB</abbr> index.<br><br>In January 2020, women\u2019s share of positions on the supervisory boards of these companies came to about 35.2%. In January 2015, it was still only 21.3%. The target of 30% was reached in 2018, which was twelve years in advance of the deadline set in the German Sustainable Development Strategy. The Gender Equality (Management Positions) Act prescribed that, in cases where elections were held for positions on the supervisory boards of the companies defined above in or after 2016, at least 30% of the seats on those boards must be occupied by women, and so compliance with the Act could be expected to yield this increase.<br><br>Given the definition used for the indicator, most of the businesses in Germany and the majority of management positions in the private sector are not taken into account. At the present time, the reported and analysed data relate to a group of 105&nbsp;companies. The positions on supervisory boards that the <abbr title=\"Women on Board\">WOB</abbr> association has examined to date, fewer than 1,600&nbsp;in number, are but a small fraction of the total of 882,000&nbsp;management positions in the private sector identified by the pay structure survey in 2018. The figures show clearly that focusing on the supervisory board of a company reveals only some of the management positions in that company.<br><br>According to the International Standard Classification of Occupations (<abbr title=\"International Standard Classification of Occupations\">ISCO</abbr>), managers are all persons who plan, direct, coordinate and evaluate the overall activities of enterprises, governments and other organisations, or of organisational units within them, and formulate and review their policies, laws, rules and regulations. This definition includes the activities of supervisory boards. If the <abbr title=\"International Standard Classification of Occupations\">ISCO</abbr> classification is used as a basis, 22% of the 882,000&nbsp;management positions in businesses were held by women in 2018. This figure is reached by considering all businesses with at least one employee for whom compulsory social insurance contributions are payable, excluding entities in sector O&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;Public administration and defence; compulsory social security&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;and parts of sector P&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;Education. Compared with 2014, the year of the previous pay structure survey, this represents an increase of 1.2&nbsp;percentage points.<br><br><b><i>Percentage of women in management positions in the federal civil service</i></b><br><br>The data basis for this indicator comprises the internal gender equality statistics collected by all offices of the federal government pursuant to the Federal Gender Equality Act. Since 2015, these statistics have been compiled every second year, updated to 30&nbsp;June, by the Federal Statistical Office on behalf of the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth. Before then they were compiled annually.<br><br>In 2019, according to preliminary data, the proportion of women in management positions in the federal civil service was about 37.6%. In 2000, the indicator value was 19.5%. This represents a 92.8% increase in the proportion of women since 2000. If the trend of the last five years were maintained, the target of virtual numerical equality in management positions in the federal civil service by 2025&nbsp;would be narrowly missed.<br><br>The indicator is focused on the employees in management positions in all departments of the federal government. Their number includes all persons employed on a full-time or part-time basis as well as those who have been given leave of absence on grounds of family or care responsibilities or have been entirely released from their normal duties. The departments of the federal civil service encompass the supreme federal authorities, the subordinate federal authorities and courts and the corporations, agencies and foundations established under federal public law.<br><br>The concept of management positions that is used in the federal gender equality statistics differs from the aforementioned <abbr title=\"International Standard Classification of Occupations\">ISCO</abbr> definition. There is therefore only limited scope for comparisons between the different statistics.<br><br>In the gender equality statistics, managers have hitherto comprised those persons who have command and leadership duties in departments of the civil service. In order to ensure a certain degree of consistency and to enable comparability of the figures, only employees with supervisory and management duties in the senior civil service are recorded in the federal ministries, irrespective of whether employees in the senior or midlevel civil service also perform such duties in these departments. As a rule, such functions, ranging from heads of division to state secretaries, are performed by staff in the higher service. In other departments, moreover, management positions may be delegated to staff in the higher intermediate or intermediate service.<br><br>The Second Gender Equality (Management Positions) Act (Zweites F\u00fchrungspositionengesetz) has specified which positions are to be included in the future statistics, which will be compiled in accordance with section 3&nbsp;of the Ordinance on Equal Opportunities Statistics (Gleichstellungsstatistikverordnung).","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.fidar.de/\">Frauen in die Aufsichtsr\u00e4te

These statements include reporting on the main environmental impacts of the organisation in question as well as data pertaining to energy and material efficiency, emissions, water, waste and use of land/biodiversity. Organisations have to update their environmental statements annually, with the exception introduced in 2010&nbsp;that <abbr title=\"Small and medium-sized enterprises\">SMEs</abbr> can apply to do so every two years instead. The environmental statement, which is public, and various additional internal documents are inspected by independent, licensed environmental verifiers.

For the cause of death statistics, all official death certificates are recorded and evaluated. The population statistics shows the current population data based on the results of the most recent census. The data relate to the old European standard population. A standard population is a modelled population that makes it possible to compare change rates over time. The cohort under one year of age, and hence infant mortality, is disregarded. The indicator is also part of the health reporting conducted by the Federal Government.<br><br>Premature mortality decreased steadily between 1991&nbsp;and 2018&nbsp;for both women (-36%) and men (-43%). The larger decline among men has also reduced the gender-specific difference in premature mortality. In 2018, for example, 151&nbsp;women and 279&nbsp;men per 100,000&nbsp;inhabitants died before the age of 70. If the trend of past years remains unchanged, however, the gender-specific targets for 2030&nbsp;will be missed.<br><br>Reflecting the steady decrease in premature mortality, life expectancy in Germany has continued to follow an upward curve.

This difference amounts to 1.4&nbsp;years.<br><br>The main cause of premature mortality in 2018&nbsp;was malignant tumours, accounting for 37.0% of premature deaths, followed by cardiovascular diseases at 20.1%. At 8.9%, fatalities due to external causes, such as accidents, poisoning and suicide, were also a significant factor. Diseases of the digestive and respiratory systems contributed with figures of 7.0% and 5.9% respectively. Since 1991, the share of malignant tumours and diseases of the respiratory system among all causes of death have increased by 11.2% and 47.1% respectively.

The aim is to reduce the share of land that is subject to elevated inputs of nitrogen by 35% by 2030&nbsp;compared with 2005.

Emissions of ammonia and nitrogen oxides are depicted as part of indicator 3.2.a on emissions of air pollutants, and developments in that area directly affect the eutrophication of ecosystems. The sensitive ecosystems covered in the calculations for this indicator are forests, natural grassland, wetlands, marshes and heathland.<br><br>Excessive inputs of nitrogen compounds from the air into land ecosystems can result in nutrient imbalances. The alterations in nutrient availability can lead, for example, to changes in the species composition of an ecosystem, with organisms which prefer nitrogen-poor locations being driven out in favour of nitrogen-loving species. Meanwhile, many plants can be rendered vulnerable to frost, drought and pests by changes in nutrient availability. The effects of excessive nitrogen inputs often take several years to manifest themselves. Likewise, the positive effects of reduced inputs will become apparent only after an extended period.<br><br>For the purposes of evaluating nitrogen inputs, ecosystem-specific critical loads are determined which represent the saturation points below which, based on the latest knowledge available, the structures, functions and biological communities of an ecosystem remain protected. In total, around 11&nbsp;million hectares, almost one third of the entire land mass of Germany, are assessed in this way.<br><br>In 2015, the critical loads for harmful nitrogen inputs were exceeded on 68% of the area of all the sensitive ecosystems assessed in Germany. Excesses were particularly high in parts of northern Germany, where agricultural activity releases large quantities of reactive nitrogen compounds.<br><br>Between 2005&nbsp;and 2011, the proportion of areas in which critical loads for nitrogen were exceeded was reduced by nine percentage points. The indicator rose again slightly in the two subsequent years before returning to the 2011&nbsp;level by 2015. The share of land where nitrogen was in excess of the critical load has thus not fallen any further since 2011.<br><br>The calculations for this indicator are produced by the Federal Environment Agency and derived from two data sets. The first of these is the critical-load data set, which the Federal Environment Agency provides for the purposes of international reporting under the aegis of the Geneva Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (<abbr title=\"Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution\">CLRTAP</abbr>). The tools used to determine that data set include the soil overview map of Germany, the map showing average annual rates of percolation into the soil, the map of land-use distribution and climatological data for Germany.

Although it would be desirable to expand the inspection to include as many stocks as possible, the high cost of these inspections means that the prospect of recording all stocks, even those that are economically less relevant and fished less extensively, is unrealistic.<br><br>Based on current estimates, a total of 58&nbsp;fish stocks in the North Sea and 20&nbsp;in the Baltic Sea are commercially exploited. The number of stocks inspected in accordance with the <abbr title=\"Maximum Sustainable Yield\">MSY</abbr> approach is currently seven for the Baltic Sea; for the North Sea, a total of 22&nbsp;stocks are taken into account.

In this context, a fish stock is defined as an independently reproducing population of a specific species of fish.

Measures taken by other parties, such as the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (<abbr title=\"German Agency for International Cooperation\">GIZ</abbr>), L\u00e4nder and private aid agencies, are not taken into account. The indicator is based exclusively on the planned scope of new funding commitments for drinking water and sanitation projects at the time of submission of the programme proposal to the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development. The <abbr title=\"Reconstruction Loan Corporation (Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau)\">KfW</abbr> assesses the number of people who, following completion of the construction projects, will have obtained first-time or improved access to drinking water and sanitation or will be able to benefit from the constructed facilities. Whether people are actually reached cannot be estimated in practice until the infrastructure has become operational, and this is not what the indicator shows. Since a person may obtain first-time or improved access to both drinking water and sanitation, double counting is possible between the two indicators and between two years.<br><br>The funding granted by the <abbr title=\"Reconstruction Loan Corporation (Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau)\">KfW</abbr> comprises grants and loans financed from the federal budget and funds raised in the financial markets. The recipients are generally developing and emerging countries, which means that this indicator is related to indicator 17.1&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;official development assistance as a proportion of gross national income.<br><br>In 2019&nbsp;the data collection method was revised. Whereas the indicator previously counted people who were reached either directly, <abbr title=\"for example (exempli gratia)\">e.g.</abbr> by domestic connections, or indirectly, <abbr title=\"for example (exempli gratia)\">e.g.</abbr> the entire population of a country supported by a sectoral reform programme, it now covers only those people who are reached directly. In 2017, for instance, of the total of 28.6&nbsp;million recorded beneficiaries, 9.5&nbsp;million were reached indirectly. In 2018, 45.1&nbsp;million out of a total of 60.3&nbsp;million were indirect beneficiaries. In 2017&nbsp;and 2018&nbsp;the indirectly reached target group represented 33.2% and 74.8% respectively of the total number of beneficiaries. Another change lies in the fact that the figure is based only on the proportion of beneficiaries who have been reached by German-funded share of measures. Contributions made by other donors and the efforts of the host country itself are not counted. Similarly, no consideration is given to energy-efficiency measures, improvements to operational processes or renewals of pumping stations, since these do not lead directly to improved access for the target group.<br><br>In recent years, the planned numbers of people who were to obtain access to drinking water and sanitation with German support have always been above the target of ten million. Under the revised methodology, the planned numbers of people who were to obtain first-time or improved access in 2019&nbsp;were about 14.3&nbsp;million for drinking water and 6.1&nbsp;million for wastewater and sanitation.<br><br>The commitments made by the <abbr title=\"Reconstruction Loan Corporation (Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau)\">KfW</abbr> with regard to drinking water and sanitation rose by 26.0% from 2012&nbsp;to 2018&nbsp;to more than <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 1&nbsp;billion. By contrast with the commitments, disbursements have steadily declined since 2015&nbsp;to the most recent figure of <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 424.9&nbsp;million.

The Labour Force Survey is conducted throughout each year and is initially summarised by <abbr title=\"European Statistical Office\">Eurostat</abbr> in the form of quarterly findings, which are then consolidated into annual average values. It covers the population living in private households but excludes people living in shared accommodation. The available labour force potential in the Labour Force Survey comprises persons who have reached the age of 15&nbsp;and who, for at least one hour during the reference week, have performed paid work or have acted as unpaid family workers. The survey also includes persons who temporarily did not work, because they were absent, for example because of leave or illness.<br><br>It should also be noted that annual average findings have been used for the employment rates since 2005. In previous years, the calculations were based on one fixed reporting week per year. From 2011&nbsp;onwards, the interviewing was redesigned in order to improve the recording of employment, and the extrapolation factor for population estimates based on the intercensal population updates was adapted in the light of the 2011&nbsp;census. From the 2016&nbsp;reference year the sampling frame was updated on the basis of the 2011&nbsp;census.<br><br>The employment rate overall (20&nbsp;to 64-year-olds) rose by 11.9&nbsp;percentage points from 68.7% in 2000&nbsp;to 80.6% in 2019, which means that the target value of 78.0% for 2030&nbsp;has already been achieved.<br><br>The employment rate for among older people (60&nbsp;to 64-year-olds) rose by 42.2&nbsp;percentage points from 19.6% in 2000&nbsp;to 61.8% in 2019. The employment rate for men in that age group had more than doubled, rising by 39.4&nbsp;percentage points to 66.6%. The rate for women even increased almost fivefold to 57.1%. And so the targeted 60% employment rate for older people in employment was likewise reached ahead of the deadline set in the German Sustainable Development Strategy.<br><br>The overall employment rates for women and men have developed in the same direction since 2000&nbsp;but at different rates. The rate for 20&nbsp;to 64-year-old men rose in the period under review by 8.1&nbsp;percentage points to 84.6%, whereas in the case of women it rose by 15.9&nbsp;percentage points to 76.6%, which was a far more rapid rise, albeit from a lower starting point. When assessing the increase in the employment rate for women, it should be taken into account that this growth was accompanied by an increase in part-time employment. In the year 2000, 61.5% of employed women worked full-time, while 38.5% worked part-time. In 2019&nbsp;the breakdown was 52.9% full-time and 47.1% part-time. By way of comparison, the proportion of the male workforce in full-time employment dropped from 95.7% in 2000&nbsp;to 90.5% in 2019.<br><br>A breakdown into age groups shows diverse employment rate trends. Among 20&nbsp;to 24-year-olds, the rate rose from 2000&nbsp;to 2019&nbsp;by 2.5&nbsp;percentage points to 67.3%. Their lower rate of employment compared with the 25- to 59-year-olds is partly due to average periods of training in colleges and universities, which delays their entry into working life. Among 25- to 59-year-olds, by contrast, the employment rate rose to 84.8%, an increase of 8.6&nbsp;percentage points from 2000&nbsp;to 2019.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a

It is managed by a network of such repositories of culture and learning from the Federal Government, the L\u00e4nder and local-authorities, and it is jointly funded by the Federal Government and the L\u00e4nder. Most of the digital materials are held not by the German Digital Library itself but by partner institutions, while the <abbr title=\"German Digital Library (Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek)\">DDB</abbr> only hosts links to those objects. The partner institutions are responsible for the stability of the connection. As of May 2020, the number of partner institutions making data available for the German Digital Library had reached 448. The majority are museums or archives&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;183&nbsp;and 174&nbsp;of them respectively.<br><br>The German Digital Library online platform has been accessible since 2012, at which point it hosted links to 5.6&nbsp;million objects. By the middle of 2020, that number had risen to 33&nbsp;million. If the trend continues as it has to date, the target of 50&nbsp;million by 2030&nbsp;could be achieved. Some of the objects made available by libraries may repeat the same content; for example, two libraries might post links in the German Digital Library to the same edition of a book. In such cases, the two links are counted separately.<br><br>Since 2015, it has been possible to differentiate between objects with and without digitised media. For those with digitised content, the German Digital Library link gives direct access to the digitised reproduction of the book, certificate, painting or other object in question. For objects without digitised media, on the other hand, the links lead only to information about them. The link pertaining to a painting, for instance, will provide information about who painted it, what year it is from and where it is kept. Objects with digitised media thus provide a good deal more information than those for which only metadata are made available.<br><br>There were 5.4&nbsp;million objects with digitised media at the end of 2015, rising to 11.3&nbsp;million by the middle of 2020.

At the end of the first half of 2020, the majority of digitised objects available via the Library were texts (60.2%), followed by pictures (33.8%) and other media (5.5%). In contrast, audio and video recordings made up only a very small proportion of digitised Library objects, at 0.4% and 0.1% respectively.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/bundesregierung/staatsministerin-fuer-kultur-und-medien\">Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/bundesregierung/staatsministerin-fuer-kultur-und-medien\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/bundesregierung/staatsministerin-fuer-kultur-und-medien\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/bkm.png\" alt=\"Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media\" style=\"height:60px;

Settlement land includes areas used for residential building, industry and commerce, public facilities, recreational amenities or cemeteries. It also covers land used for surface or sub-surface mining. However, mining land is not counted in the calculations for this indicator, as it ends up being reclaimed for other uses in the long term (<abbr title=\"for example (exempli gratia)\">e.g.</abbr> as renaturalised post-mining landscapes). Transport area is made up of four subcategories: road transport, rail, aviation and shipping. The indicator therefore refers not only to sealed areas but also to undeveloped and unsealed land. These include, for example, domestic gardens, parks and other green spaces. As calculated in the environmental economic accounts compiled by the L\u00e4nder, the sealed share of their settlement and transport area is estimated at 45% on average (2017).<br><br>The indicator is derived from the area survey by type of actual use (official land-use statistics), which in turn is based on data from the official land register maintained by the L\u00e4nder. Some areas of land have been reclassified in the official land register in recent years without any actual change in the way they are used. To balance out the effect this has on the statistics for any particular year, a four-year moving average is also shown, averaging out the year in question and the three preceding years. Moreover, the switch from the old to the new land-use classification system was completed in 2016, which affected the official land-use statistics such that the data for 2016&nbsp;are not directly comparable to those for previous years. It is for this reason that the overall indicator value for 2016&nbsp;is also not subdivided into types of settlement or transport use.<br><br>From 2000&nbsp;to 2018, 5,880&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Square kilometer\">km\u00b2</abbr> of land was converted into settlement and transport area. This is equivalent to more than twice the area of Saarland. The majority, 84%, was converted into settlement land, while 16% went to accommodate transport infrastructure.<br><br>The four-year moving average of previously undeveloped areas newly converted to settlement or transport area continuously decreased throughout the time series, going from 129&nbsp;hectares per day in 2000&nbsp;down to 56&nbsp;hectares per day in 2018. Considered for each reporting year separately, the value for new settlement or transport area was lowest in 2016, at 51&nbsp;hectares per day. The figure has risen again since then, to 58&nbsp;hectares per day in 2018.<br><br>In 2018, the area of settlement or transport use amounted to 49,819&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Square kilometer\">km\u00b2</abbr>, or 14% of the total area of Germany. The largest land types in Germany are agricultural land at 181,625&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Square kilometer\">km\u00b2</abbr> (51%) followed by woodland at 106,546&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Square kilometer\">km\u00b2</abbr> (30%).<br><br>Settlement and transport area grew by 565&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Square kilometer\">km\u00b2</abbr> between 2016&nbsp;and 2018.

Provided by <abbr title=\"Transport Emission Estimation Model\">TREMOD</abbr>, this figure is used to calculate the specific level of energy consumption in this sector. In the aviation statistics, only domestic flights are taken into account. International flights departing from or landing in German territory are not counted. Nor is waterborne passenger transport included.<br><br>Some 30.1% of overall final energy consumption can be attributed to transport. Of this, more than 70% is accounted for by passenger transport. Savings in final energy consumption in passenger transport therefore have a marked effect on total energy consumption in Germany. The number of passenger-kilometres provides information about the extent to which transport intensity or the distance per transported tonne changes. In addition to final energy consumption, the indicator also examines energy efficiency in passenger transport, measured in terms of energy consumption per passenger-kilometre.<br><br>Final energy consumption in passenger transport decreased by a total of 0.9% between 2005&nbsp;and 2018. However, analysis of progress since 2008&nbsp;reveals that the indicator value increased by 1.1%, meaning that final energy consumption in passenger transport is developing contrary to the target set in the German Sustainable Development Strategy.<br><br>Although the number of passenger-kilometres covered increased by 9.0% between 2005&nbsp;and 2018, energy consumption with reference to all forms of transport fell by 9.1% to 1.49&nbsp;megajoules per passenger-kilometre during the same period. This indicates a notable increase in efficiency in passenger transport. A particularly large share of the efficiency gain can be attributed to the railways. The number of passenger-kilometres travelled by rail rose by 25.3%, while final energy consumption was reduced by 8.9%. This equates to a 27.3% increase in efficiency. A significant increase in efficiency was also achieved in aviation, with a 17.1% rise compared with 2005. Road transport registered a slight gain in efficiency of 7.4% recently, thanks to a rise in passenger-kilometres, even though final energy consumption remained almost constant (-0.5%).<br><br>Private motorised transport by car or two-wheeled vehicle accounted for 81.4% of total passenger transport volumes in 2018. Its share in 2017&nbsp;was 81.6%. It can be subdivided into various categories. In 2017&nbsp;(more recent figures not yet available), work-related transport, <abbr title=\"that is to say (id est)\">i.e.</abbr> commuter traffic and business travel, accounted for the largest share, at 39.2%, followed by recreational transport at 29.5%. Travel for shopping accounted for 17.1%. These purpose-based categories of transport have developed differently since 2005. Work-related travel in particularly has increased significantly (+30.0%), while journeys for recreation or shopping have declined (-11.4% and -2.7% respectively).","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/destatis.png\" alt=\"Federal Statistical Office\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Statistical Office\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"<a href=\"https://www.ifeu.de/en/\">Institute for Energy and Environmental Research</a>","source_organisation_2_short":"<a href=\"https://www.ifeu.de/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Institute for Energy and Environmental Research</a>","source_organisation_logo_2":"<a href=\"https://www.ifeu.de/en/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/ifeu.png\" alt=\"Institute for Energy and Environmental Research\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationInstitute for Energy and Environmental Research\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","source_url_2":"https://www.ifeu.de/en/methods-tools/models/tremod/","source_url_text_2":"TREMOD","weather_active_1":true,"weather_indicator_1":"11.2.b Final energy consumption in passenger transport","weather_indicator_1_year_a":2020,"weather_indicator_1_year_b":2019,"weather_indicator_1_year_c":2018,"weather_indicator_1_year_d":2017,"weather_indicator_1_year_e":2016,"weather_indicator_1_year_f":2015,"weather_indicator_1_year_g":2014,"weather_indicator_1_target":"Reduction by 15\u201320% by 2030","weather_indicator_1_target_1":"Reduction by 15\u201320% by 2030","weather_indicator_1_target_1_category":"normal","weather_indicator_1_target_1_targetYear":2030,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_title":"If the trend from 2020 had continued, the target value would have been reached or missed by less than 5% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b":"Blitz","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b_title":"In 2019 the distance to the target was constantly high or had increased.

The public sector accounts for a considerable share of demand for products and services.

The German Government\u2019s aim is to strengthen sustainability across public procurement generally.","data_state":"The data published in the indicator report 2022 is as of Oct 31 2022.

The Blue Angel is an ecolabel for environmentally friendly products and services. When awarded to paper, it means that 100% of the paper fibres were recovered from wastepaper and that no harmful chemicals or bleaching agents were used in the production process.<br><br>According to the preliminary data, the proportion of Blue Angel-certified paper rose by around 104% between 2015&nbsp;and 2019. In 2015, 45% of all the paper used by the direct federal administration bore the Blue Angel label; that figure had risen to 92% by 2019. This equates to an increase of 104.1% (or an index value of 204.1). The indicator is thus in line with the target set in the Programme of Sustainability Measures to raise the use of paper with the Blue Angel label to 95% by 2020. Total paper consumption, after rising by 11.5% to 993.4&nbsp;million sheets of paper in 2016, shrank again in 2019, according to the (provisional) data, resulting in a 13.6% reduction in total paper consumption between 2015&nbsp;and 2019.<br><br>When comparing the data over time, it should be noted that there was a change in methodology in 2018&nbsp;regarding the definition of paper. Since the 2018&nbsp;reporting year, only non-coloured A4-sized printer and copier paper has been included in the data. The reduction in total paper use can in part be traced to this methodological change.<br><br>More generally, it should be noted that the use of Blue Angel-certified paper has limited relevance in terms of sustainable procurement overall, as paper accounts for a small proportion of the total financial volumes involved in procurement for the public sector.<br><br><b><i><abbr title=\"Carbon dioxide\">CO\u2082</abbr> emissions of motor vehicles Of the public sector milage</i></b><br><br>The data on publicly owned vehicles are provided by the environmental economic accounts compiled by the Federal Statistical Office using the <abbr title=\"Transport Emission Estimation Model\">TREMOD</abbr> (Transport Emissions Estimation Model) database at the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research. The public sector comprises the federal government, the L\u00e4nder and municipalities, the police, the Federal Border Police and the fire services.<br><br>Because of the small number of data points and a methodological change affecting the <abbr title=\"Transport Emission Estimation Model\">TREMOD</abbr> database in 2016, it is not possible to assess the trend. The definitions of vehicles have been modified, which is reflected in the data on vehicle fleets. There have also been alterations in the outcomes for distance travelled, energy consumed and emissions in the environmental economic accounts.<br><br>If, instead of looking at publicly owned vehicles, one focuses on vehicles owned by the direct federal administration, average <abbr title=\"Carbon dioxide\">CO\u2082</abbr> emissions amounted to 203.3&nbsp;grams per kilometre travelled in 2019. There was a methodological change in the statistics of the Federal Environment Agency as well.<br><br>The direct federal administration encompasses federal government\u2019s own central and subordinate authorities, which are legally dependent. The data on <abbr title=\"Carbon dioxide\">CO\u2082</abbr> emissions per kilometre travelled for vehicles owned by the direct federal administration are provided by Federal Environment Agency. <br><br>As for the data on publicly owned vehicles, the direct federal administration figures count all passenger vehicles weighing up to 3.5&nbsp;tonnes but not light commercial vehicles within that class. Between 2015&nbsp;and 2017, the proportion of vehicles newly acquired for the direct federal administration that produced emissions lower than 50&nbsp;grams per kilometre rose from 2.6% to 4.1% of all newly purchased vehicles. That share fell back to 3.3% in 2018. The provisional data show it falling further in 2019, to 2.4%.<br><br>The indicator under consideration here relates only to the environmental aspect of sustainability. Moreover, it only covers the <abbr title=\"Carbon dioxide\">CO\u2082</abbr> emissions released during the vehicles\u2019 operation. Looking at their entire life-cycle costs, there are more greenhouse-gas emissions, occurring during the processes of manufacturing and waste disposal, which would have to be taken into account for a conclusive indicator. In addition, the sustainability of electric vehicles depends on whether the electricity powering them comes from conventional or renewable sources.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"http://www.nachhaltige-beschaffung.info/DE/Home/home_node.html\">Competence Center for Sustainable Procurement</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"http://www.nachhaltige-beschaffung.info/DE/Home/home_node.html\" target=\"_blank\">Competence Center for Sustainable Procurement</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"http://www.nachhaltige-beschaffung.info/DE/Home/home_node.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/knb.png\" alt=\"Competence Center for Sustainable Procurement\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationCompetence Center for Sustainable Procurement\" style=\"height:60px;

This special evaluation found that the number of projects run per year rose from 8&nbsp;in 2006&nbsp;to 31&nbsp;in 2019. According to the evaluation, the goal of Germany involving itself through at least 15&nbsp;projects annually was already achieved for the first time in 2012. With the exception of 2013, that target was also reached or even exceeded in the years that followed. The regional focuses of Germany\u2019s involvement were in East and West Africa, the Western Balkans and Ukraine. Other projects were supported in Latin America and the Caribbean. It is possible that projects with run-times longer than one year were counted more than once.<br><br>The projects reported are not all financed exclusively by the Federal Foreign Office but may also receive third-party funds. The indicator therefore includes those projects only partially funded from the public purse. Notably, the number of projects carried out says nothing about their scale or their level of success. Clearly formulated and communicated criteria are essential, moreover, for a project to be unequivocally categorised as in line with the indicator\u2019s aims. The German Government\u2019s Annual Disarmament Report contains a list of projects with the objective of <abbr title=\"Small arms and light weapons\">SALW</abbr> control, alongside their sources of funding. Their number differs from those reported for this indicator. One reason for this may be the particular focus of individual projects, which affects whether they are taken into account. This means that the indicator depicts more than the extent of state involvement in these projects.<br><br>In accordance with the guidelines on statistical reporting issued by its Development Assistance Committee, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (<abbr title=\"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\">OECD</abbr>) also publishes detailed figures on projects for reintegration and <abbr title=\"Small arms and light weapons\">SALW</abbr> control (<abbr title=\"Creditor Reporting System\">CRS</abbr> Purpose Code 15240).

It has a value between 0&nbsp;and 1. If everyone had exactly the same income, the coefficient would be 0. If all of the income went to a single person&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;the situation of maximum inequality&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;it would have a value of 1. The smaller the Gini coefficient, the greater the equality in income distribution.<br><br>Equivalised income is a value derived from the total income of a household and the number and age of the people living on that income. With the help of an equivalence scale, the incomes are weighted according to household size and composition, as the shared use of living space and household appliances results in savings. With the equivalised income then allocated equally to each household member, it becomes possible to compare people\u2019s incomes independently of age or household size. A household\u2019s equivalised disposable income is the income, including social transfers, which remains after taxes and other deductions, and is therefore the income available for spending and saving. A distinction must be made between this measure and equivalised income before social transfers, which looks at disposable income without any possible welfare payments, such as unemployment benefit or housing assistance, or market income, which is calculated before taxes, social contributions and social benefits. In none of these ways of looking at income is a differentiation made between the sources of income, <abbr title=\"that is to say (id est)\">i.e.</abbr> whether it takes the form of wages, rental income or capital gains.<br><br>The data used to calculate equivalised income come from the annual harmonised European statistics on income and living conditions (<abbr title=\"Statistics on Income and Living Conditions\">EU-SILC</abbr>).<br><br>The wealth distribution figures are taken from the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS) conducted on an irregular basis by the European Central Bank. The fact that households with high incomes and/or extensive assets are under-represented in voluntary sample surveys is compensated for methodologically. Therefore, this methodology, the values for income as well as for assets in Germany can be compared with those in Europe or the euro area. Since no Gini coefficient is calculated for market income from the <abbr title=\"Statistics on Income and Living Conditions\">EU-SILC</abbr>, data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (<abbr title=\"Socio-Economic Panel\">SOEP</abbr>) held by the German Institute for Economic Research are used instead.<br><br>As in previous years, the Gini coefficient for equivalised disposable income in Germany for 2019&nbsp;(0.297) is close to the value for the <abbr title=\"European Union\">EU</abbr> as a whole (0.307) and has remained stable. There are therefore no significant differences in income distribution to be discerned between Germany and Europe as a whole. At 0.297, the Gini coefficient for equivalised disposable income remains clearly below that for equivalised income before social benefits (0.352). As expected, the 2017&nbsp;Gini coefficient for market income was higher, at 0.500. Social benefits, social insurance and taxes in Germany contribute considerably to reducing inequalities in disposable income.<br><br>Measured by the relevant Gini coefficients, the distribution of wealth in Germany, at 0.739&nbsp;in 2017, is considerably less equal than that of income. In this context, virtually no change can be detected over time (2010: 0.758&nbsp;and 2014: 0.762). The equivalent value for the euro area in 2017&nbsp;was lower than Germany\u2019s, at 0.695. However, the impression of above-average wealth inequality is qualified by several factors not covered by the Gini coefficient. For instance, the assessment of wealth does not take future pension entitlements into account. Moreover, Germany\u2019s higher level of protection for tenants means that people here are more likely to rent rather than own their homes compared with other European countries.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/destatis.png\" alt=\"Federal Statistical Office\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Statistical Office\" style=\"height:60px;

The surveys initially took place at intervals of three to four years, but since 2001&nbsp;they have been conducted almost every year. In order to ensure that the data are comparable over time, they are weighted on the basis of gender, region and age. The data for years without surveys have been interpolated for inclusion in the time series. The random sample used in 2019&nbsp;comprised 7,000&nbsp;adolescents and young adults.<br><br>The data for adults is surveyed every four years as part of the microcensus conducted by the Federal Statistical Office. The data for years without surveys have been interpolated for inclusion in the time series for the indicator. The microcensus, which is a sample survey, covers 1% of the whole population and is the largest household survey in Germany and Europe. The responses to the questions regarding smoking habits are voluntary and were provided by 79% of respondents in 2017.<br><br>In the group of adolescents between 12&nbsp;and 17&nbsp;years of age, the proportion of smokers initially increased from 23.9% (1995) to 28.1% (1997&nbsp;and 2001), but then declined steadily to 5.6% (5.2% for adolescent girls, 6.0% of adolescent boys) by 2019. Provided that the trend of recent years is maintained, the target value set for 2030&nbsp;is already achieved.<br><br>In 2017, a total of 22.4% of the sample population above the age of 15&nbsp;indicated that they smoked occasionally or regularly. This compares with a figure of 28.3&nbsp;% for 1995&nbsp;and 1999. The smoking rate for adults, in other words, has shown only a slight decrease. If the average trend over the last five years is maintained, the target for this sub-indicator can also be achieved.<br><br>In 2017, 18.8% of all adult respondents aged 15&nbsp;years or older considered themselves regular smokers, while 3.7% smoked occasionally. The rate among women (18.6%) was significantly lower than for men (26.4%). While the proportion of women smokers has fallen by 2.9&nbsp;percentage points since 1995, the proportion of men who smoke has dropped by 9.2&nbsp;percentage points.<br><br>In 2017, 96.2% of the respondent smokers preferred cigarettes. The frequency of tobacco consumption is important when considering the threat to the health of individuals. A total of 10.8% of regular smokers, compared with 17.4% in 1995, fell into the category of heavy smokers with more than 20&nbsp;cigarettes a day, while 81.4% smoked 5&nbsp;to 20&nbsp;a day. Within these figures there were also differences between the sexes. Almost one in seven of the male regular cigarette smokers was a heavy smoker, but only one in thirteen of the female smokers.<br><br>Smoking poses a high but avoidable risk to health. In 2018, 4.8% of all deaths (3.4% among women, 6.3% among men) could be attributed to symptomatic diseases for smokers (lung, bronchial, laryngeal and tracheal cancers). In 2018, the average age of those who died of lung, bronchial, and tracheal cancers was 71.1&nbsp;years, which is more than seven years below the average age at death (78.4&nbsp;years). Lower smoking rates would therefore help reduce premature mortality.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bzga.de/home/bzga/\">Federal Centre for Health Education</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.bzga.de/home/bzga/\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Centre for Health Education</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bzga.de/home/bzga/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/bzga.png\" alt=\"Federal Centre for Health Education\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Centre for Health Education\" style=\"height:60px;

This involves some 14,000&nbsp;private households in Germany, which voluntarily provide information about their income and living conditions annually.<br><br>Both indicators show the percentage of the population who, in their own estimation, involuntarily forego consumption or experience shortages in several areas for financial reasons. Purchases of selected lifestyle items considered in Europe to be appropriate, desirable or even essential were used as evaluation criteria. These nine criteria used to define material deprivation are standardised for all countries in which the <abbr title=\"Statistics on Income and Living Conditions\">EU-SILC</abbr> survey is conducted, which makes <abbr title=\"European Union\">EU</abbr>-wide comparisons possible.<br><br>Specifically, the nine attributes are as follows: the lack of a car, a washing machine, a colour TV or a telephone in the household (in each case because the household is unable to afford one), a financial problem paying rent, mortgage or utility bills on time, being unable to provide for adequate heating in the home, being unable to eat meat, fish or an equivalent vegetarian meal every second day, not being able to spend a one-week holiday away from home each year or being unable to meet unexpected expenditure of a specific amount (<abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 1,050&nbsp;in 2018) from the household budget.<br><br>Material deprivation is associated with the problem of social exclusion, because participation in social life is jeopardised by a lack of funds.

If the trend seen over the last five reporting years continues, the target for 2020&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;a reduction of 40% compared with 1990&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;is unlikely to be reached.<br><br>By far the greatest share of total greenhouse-gas emissions in 2019&nbsp;was carbon dioxide, at 87.7%, compared with 84.1% in 1990. Most recently, methane accounted for 6.2% of the total, with nitrous oxide on 4.3%, <abbr title=\"Hydrofluorocarbons\">HFCs</abbr> on 1.3% and sulphur hexafluoride on 0.5% (the latter two being figures for 2017). By far the largest proportion of <abbr title=\"Carbon dioxide\">CO\u2082</abbr> emissions arise from the generation of electricity and heat. Methane and nitrous oxide are emitted primarily by agricultural production.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en\">German Environment

The reference value in the percentage computation is the total utilised agricultural area determined in the annual land survey. The agriculturally utilised area comprises all surfaces used for agricultural or horticultural purposes. Accordingly, building and farmyard areas of agricultural holdings are not included in the reference value.<br><br>The data collected by the <abbr title=\"Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture\">BMEL</abbr> includes details of the amount of organically farmed land reported annually by the organic regulatory authorities of the L\u00e4nder. The reporting date is 31&nbsp;December of each year. All reports for a current year are accumulated no later than this reporting date. The values shown in the data held by the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture are somewhat higher. One of the reasons for this is that areas not subject to cut-off thresholds are measured against areas to which cut-off thresholds apply. This means that, in the calculation of the percentage, the numerator includes very small plots, whereas only areas of a certain minimum size count towards the denominator.<br><br>According to the data held by the Federal Statistical Office, the share of organically farmed land increased from 2.9% to 7.8% of the utilised agricultural area between 1999&nbsp;and 2019. The figure for 2019&nbsp;corresponds to an organically farmed area of 1.29&nbsp;million hectares. The data from the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture indicate a higher percentage of organically farmed agricultural land. According to those data the value for 2019&nbsp;was 9.7% or 1.61&nbsp;million hectares.<br><br>Although the last few years have seen a further increase in the area of organically farmed land, the annual percentage increase from year to year has fluctuated widely. Percentage growth stagnated, for example, between 2016&nbsp;and 2017&nbsp;but rose sharply again in the period from 2017&nbsp;to 2019.

By contrast, the main use in agriculture as a whole was as arable land, with 70.4%, while the share of permanent pasture was 28.5% and other uses accounted for 1.2% of total utilised agricultural area. According to the results of the 2016&nbsp;agricultural structure survey, Bavaria held the largest share of organically farmed land among all the L\u00e4nder with around 23%, followed by Brandenburg with 12% and Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg with just under 12%.<br><br>The conversion to organic farming is promoted to varying degrees by the individual L\u00e4nder.<br><br>According to <abbr title=\"European Statistical Office\">Eurostat</abbr> data, a total area of 13.4&nbsp;million hectares was organically farmed in the <abbr title=\"European Union consisting of 28&nbsp;member states\">EU-28</abbr>&nbsp;states in 2018.

Particulate matter, however, can also occur through the formation of secondary particles as a result of chemical reactions with precursors such as sulphur oxide, nitrogen oxides, ammonia and organic carbon.<br><br>The particulate matter (<abbr title=\"Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 10&nbsp;micrometers)\">PM\u2081\u2080</abbr>) contained in the air is measured at a total of more than 370&nbsp;air monitoring sites in both metropolitan and rural areas of Germany. For methodological reasons, the indicator is based only on the readings from the monitoring sites that are not exposed to direct particulate emissions from traffic or to any other significant local sources, because these measure only high localised concentrations (hot spots) and not area-wide particulate air pollution. From a combination of model results with the measured monitoring data on background concentrations, the particulate concentrations for the whole area of Germany are obtained. These concentrations are combined with information on population distribution to determine the number of persons who are exposed to annual mean particulate pollution of more than 20&nbsp;micrograms per cubic metre of air at their place of residence. Since the model includes only those monitoring sites which are not exposed to direct particulate emissions from local sources, it may be assumed that the indicator underestimates the actual number of persons whose exposure to particulate matter exceeds the guideline value of the World Health Organization.<br><br>Rather than reflecting nationwide adherence to the guideline value, the indicator therefore depicts the level of adherence for the population who live in places remote from sources of high particulate emissions. It says nothing about the exposure level of the population as a whole or about variations in the course of the year. This indicator, moreover, does not take separate account of emissions of finer particulates (<abbr title=\"Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 2.5&nbsp;micrometers)\">PM\u2082.\u2085</abbr> and <abbr title=\"Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 0.1&nbsp;micrometers)\">PM\u2080.\u2081</abbr>).<br><br>Exposure to <abbr title=\"Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 10&nbsp;micrometers)\">PM\u2081\u2080</abbr> fell considerably from 2007&nbsp;to 2018. The average exposure, weighted by population, was around 18.9&nbsp;micrograms per cubic metre of air in 2007, it was down to about 15.4&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Micrograms per cubic metre\">\u00b5g/m\u00b3</abbr> by 2018. Over the same period there was also a sharp fall in the number of people who were exposed at their place of residence to annual mean concentrations of more than 20&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Micrograms\">\u00b5g</abbr> of <abbr title=\"Particulate matter (diameter smaller than 10&nbsp;micrometers)\">PM\u2081\u2080</abbr> per <abbr title=\"Cubic metre\">m\u00b3</abbr>. In 2007, there were 29.7&nbsp;million such persons, but in 2018&nbsp;there were only about 2.9&nbsp;million.<br><br>Weather also influences the measurements of airborne particulate matter. Part of the reason for the sharp drop in 2011&nbsp;and subsequent years is presumably that there were relatively few instances of temperature inversion in the winter months, although that curve has flattened out since 2015.

This means that even those young people who, for example, have successfully completed lower secondary education at a Hauptschule or intermediate secondary education at a Realschule but are no longer in the education process are counted as early school leavers.<br><br>The data for this indicator originate from the microcensus, which is based on an annual sample survey covering 1% of the population.

Besides the tertiary diplomas awarded by universities, universities of applied sciences, colleges of public administration, vocational academies, technical colleges and specialised academies and master craftsmen\u2019s and technician\u2019s diplomas, there are numerous post-secondary non-tertiary certificates nationwide. In general terms, these include all certificates awarded on completion of post-Abitur vocational courses but also qualifications in health professions obtained by students who do not have an Abitur, for example on completion of training as a medical laboratory technician.<br><br>The International Standard Classification of Education (<abbr title=\"International Standard Classification of Education\">ISCED</abbr>) serves as the basis for international comparison of statistics and indicators regarding educational certificates. Certificates regarded as equivalents are assigned to the same <abbr title=\"International Standard Classification of Education\">ISCED</abbr> level. The indicator therefore covers both the tertiary diplomas corresponding to <abbr title=\"International Standard Classification of Education\">ISCED</abbr> levels 5&nbsp;to 8&nbsp;and the post-secondary non-tertiary certificates corresponding to <abbr title=\"International Standard Classification of Education\">ISCED</abbr> level 4.<br><br>The data used for the indicator are obtained from the microcensus, which is based on an annual sample survey covering 1% of the population.

If the average growth rate of the last five reference years is maintained, the target value of 55% could be achieved considerably earlier than 2030. The relation between the gender-specific percentages has changed over time. In 1999, the indicator for men was 3.8&nbsp;percentage points higher than for women. In 2006, the values were the same for both sexes. Since 2007, the percentage of women with a tertiary or post-secondary non-tertiary qualification has been higher that of men. If the average trend of the past five reference years is examined for these figures too, it emerges that the proportion of women qualified to these levels, having reached 54.4% in 2019, could already overachieve the 55% target in 2020. While the proportion of men, which was 46.8% in 2019, would reach the target a good bit later. <br><br>In many other countries there are no post-secondary non-tertiary qualifications.

This indicator reflects three of the factors behind this impact, namely energy, <abbr title=\"Carbon dioxide\">CO\u2082</abbr> emissions and the use of raw materials. The relevant data are collected  in the environmental economic accounts of a range of governmental and non-governmental sources.<br><br>Resources may be consumed by households directly or indirectly. Direct consumption might be the use of gas for heating, fuel for transport or food to eat. Resources are also tied up or consumed at every stage of the process of manufacturing and transporting consumer goods both within Germany and abroad. All of that counts as indirect consumption by German private households when they buy and use those goods. Both types of consumption are included in the present indicator, the environmental impact represented in terms of energy, raw materials and <abbr title=\"Carbon dioxide\">CO\u2082</abbr>.<br><br>The use of raw materials, energy consumption and <abbr title=\"Carbon dioxide\">CO\u2082</abbr> emissions are closely interconnected. To use coal, oil and gas&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;material resources&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;in power plants and boilers to produce electricity and heat is simultaneously to consume energy. As a rule, the burning of fuels also results in the emission of <abbr title=\"Carbon dioxide\">CO\u2082</abbr>.<br><br>However, the use of raw materials is not restricted to fuels. This is clear from the time series in the graph: while the data for energy consumption and emissions follow a fluctuating but generally downwards trend, the change in the use of raw materials is less marked. That factor is made up both of abiotic resources, which include other mineral resources like sand and salts as well as fuels, and of renewable resources like the products of farming and forestry. While the use of abiotic resources is steadily shrinking, there are greater fluctuations in the area of agricultural products. This resulted in a slight overall reduction of 3% between 2010&nbsp;and 2016.<br><br>In contrast, energy consumption went down by 6% during the same period. Energy loss incurred during the generation of electricity and district heat for consumption by private households is counted as indirect consumption. Energy consumption can be split according to the different fields in which it occurs, namely home life, transport, food, other products and services. At around 3,402&nbsp;petajoules in total, home life accounted for the largest proportion, 36% of private household consumption, in 2016.<br><br>A similar trend can be seen in <abbr title=\"Carbon dioxide\">CO\u2082</abbr> emissions. The vast majority of emissions are generated indirectly, during the manufacturing process of consumer goods in Germany and abroad, rather than during the actual consumption of the goods. The total <abbr title=\"Carbon dioxide\">CO\u2082</abbr> emissions caused by private household consumption in 2016&nbsp;amounted to 667&nbsp;million tonnes. The ratio of direct to indirect emissions was around 1:2. Between 2010&nbsp;and 2016, direct <abbr title=\"Carbon dioxide\">CO\u2082</abbr> emissions fell by 6%, while the emissions footprint of consumer goods fell by 1%. The last five years, on the other hand, show no reduction but a slight increase in emissions.<br><br>This indicator can be usefully cross-referenced with indicator 8.1&nbsp;on raw material input productivity.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/destatis.png\" alt=\"Federal Statistical Office\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Statistical Office\" style=\"height:60px;

Nitrogen removal takes place through plant and animal market products. The surplus nitrogen may escape in gaseous form into the atmosphere, be enriched in the soil or leach into groundwater. In this way it can ultimately find its way into rivers or other ecosystems too. Here, the nitrogen surplus in agriculture has a direct effect on the trend in indicators 6.1.b (Nitrate in groundwater), 14.1.a (Nitrogen input via the inflows into the North and Baltic Seas) and 15.2&nbsp;(Eutrophication of ecosystems) In the case of indicator 3.2.a (Emissions of air pollutants), nitrogen is released into the atmosphere as a result of agriculture impacts on the formation of nitrogen dioxides and ammonia.<br><br>The indicator is calculated by the Institute for Crop and Soil Science at the Julius K\u00fchn Institute and the Institute of Landscape Ecology and Resources Management at the University of Giessen. <br><br>For 2018, fertilisers were found to be the main source of nitrogen input, accounting for 54.5% (94&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Kilogram\">kg</abbr> nitrogen per hectare) in the overall nitrogen balance. Other important sources of nitrogen input were animal feed, with 34.1% (59&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Kilogram per hectare\">kg/ha</abbr>), biological fixation, with 7.6% (13&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Kilogram per hectare\">kg/ha</abbr>) and non-agricultural emissions, with 1.8% (3&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Kilogram per hectare\">kg/ha</abbr>). The calculation of the indicator is based on a five-year moving average, the mean value being obtained from five reference years. The five-year moving average provides the value for the middle year of the five reference years. The figure thus takes account of year-to-year fluctuations caused by meteorological and market conditions which are beyond the control of farms. The indicator gives no information on the regional distribution of nitrogen surpluses. For the years 2016&nbsp;and 2017&nbsp;various input data were retrospectively updated. The calculation method was also revised, and some coefficients were updated. This has given rise to divergences from the indicator values shown in the previous publication.<br><br>In the period from 1992&nbsp;to 2016, the moving five-year average nitrogen surplus fell by 19.9% from 116.6&nbsp;to 93.3&nbsp;kilograms per hectare/year. The reductions in the nitrogen surplus, however, are largely due to developments from the start of the time series until 2011. Since then the nitrogen surplus has stagnated, and it now remains at the 2011&nbsp;level of 93&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Kilogram per hectare\">kg/ha</abbr>. If the current trend continues, the aim of a reduction to an annual average of 70&nbsp;kilograms per hectare of utilised agricultural area by the reference period 2028-2032&nbsp;will not be achievable. The significant reduction of the nitrogen surplus at the start of the 1990s resulted from reduced use of fertilisers and falling livestock numbers in the new L\u00e4nder. The comparatively meagre decline over the remainder of the time series stemmed from a slight decline in the use of mineral fertilisers and higher crop yields resulting from technical progress in plant production and cultivation, reflected in more efficient nitrogen usage and in the range of crop varieties. The same period has seen increases in the area given over to high-yield crops, such as maize and wheat, and improvements in feed conversion efficiency in livestock farming.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bmel.de/EN/Home/home_node.html\">Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.bmel.de/EN/Home/home_node.html\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bmel.de/EN/Home/home_node.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/bmel.png\" alt=\"Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Ministry of Food and Agriculture\" style=\"height:60px;

The data record fuel consumption within Germany irrespective of where refuelling takes place. \u201cFinal energy\u201d refers to that part of the total energy used that is directly consumed in transport. It does not cover the conversion losses that arise during the production of fuels or any pipeline losses that may occur.<br><br><abbr title=\"Transport Emission Estimation Model\">TREMOD</abbr> also supplies the goods transport volumes which are used to calculate the specific energy consumption of this sector. Air freight transport is not included, as it accounts for negligibly small volumes.<br><br>By definition, the indicator for final energy consumption in goods transport refers to consumption within Germany. It gives only an inadequate reflection of the German economy\u2019s increasingly complex international ties in a globalised world. As a result, transport flows and the associated energy consumption that arises due to German exports and imports are not included.<br><br>The energy-consumption data presented here is supplemented by energy efficiency, or energy consumed per tonne-kilometre. The number of tonne-kilometres provides information about the extent to which transport intensity or the distance per transported tonne changes.<br><br>Contrary to the German Government\u2019s target, final energy consumption for the carriage of goods was 6.2% higher in 2018&nbsp;compared with 2005. Goods thereby accounted for almost 30% of total final energy consumption in the transport sector. The sharp increase can be attributed primarily to freight transport by road. Final energy consumption in road goods transport increased by 7.8% during this period, while consumption for rail and inland shipping was significantly reduced (-5.3% and -26.7% respectively).<br><br>During the same period, goods transport volumes increased by 22.0%. In conjunction with comparable energy consumption in 2005&nbsp;and 2018, this means a significant increase in efficiency of 13.0% during that time.<br><br>During the economic crisis of 2009, price-adjusted gross value added in the manufacturing industry suffered a particularly sharp decline of just under 20%. This heavy loss particularly affected the transport sector, which reacts directly to increases and falls in the production of goods. The resultant decrease in the utilisation of transport capacity explains why average energy consumption per tonne-kilometre rose slightly despite the sharp fall in overall energy consumption in absolute terms during the crisis years.<br><br>Besides the more short-term consequences of the economic crisis of 2009, a number of long-term ramifications also affected the development of final energy consumption in goods transport during the 2005&nbsp;to 2018&nbsp;review period. For instance, there was a decrease in the average number of manufacturing steps a company performs, something that is normally associated with greater transport volumes because companies procure more intermediate goods from domestic and international suppliers. Furthermore, the average distance between where goods are manufactured and where they are used increased, which also caused transport volumes to rise. These effects are countered by a shift towards a less material-intensive pattern of demand (<abbr title=\"for example (exempli gratia)\">e.g.</abbr> increasing demand for services). The resulting change in the composition of goods volumes dampened the increase in transport-related energy consumption.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/destatis.png\" alt=\"Federal Statistical Office\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Statistical Office\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"<a href=\"https://www.ifeu.de/en/\">Institute for Energy and Environmental Research</a>","source_organisation_2_short":"<a href=\"https://www.ifeu.de/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Institute for Energy and Environmental Research</a>","source_organisation_logo_2":"<a href=\"https://www.ifeu.de/en/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/ifeu.png\" alt=\"Institute for Energy and Environmental Research\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationInstitute for Energy and Environmental Research\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","source_url_2":"https://www.ifeu.de/en/methods-tools/models/tremod/","source_url_text_2":"TREMOD","weather_active_1":true,"weather_indicator_1":"11.2.a Final energy consumption in goods transport","weather_indicator_1_year_a":2020,"weather_indicator_1_year_b":2019,"weather_indicator_1_year_c":2018,"weather_indicator_1_year_d":2017,"weather_indicator_1_year_e":2016,"weather_indicator_1_year_f":2015,"weather_indicator_1_year_g":2014,"weather_indicator_1_target":"Reduction by 15\u201320% by 2030","weather_indicator_1_target_1":"Reduction by 15\u201320% by 2030","weather_indicator_1_target_1_category":"normal","weather_indicator_1_target_1_targetYear":2030,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_title":"Although the indicator has in 2020 been moving in the desired direction toward the target, if the trend had to continued, the target would have been missed in the target year by more than 20% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b":"Blitz","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b_title":"In 2019 the distance to the target was constantly high or had increased.

The indicator expresses housing costs relative to disposable household income. If a household is receiving housing benefits or comparable social benefits, such as social-security payments for accommodation and heating, these are also included in the calculations. These social benefits are not added to the income amount but are deducted from the housing costs, so that the burden of housing expenses on households that rely on housing-related social benefits is reduced or almost nullified.<br><br>The purchase of owner-occupied property is not included in housing costs. Other spending on measures to enhance the value of a property is not taken into account either&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;though it is not always possible to clearly differentiate such spending from value-maintaining expenditure, which does count as part of housing costs. In such cases, established assumptions are applied to simplify the calculation. Nor does the indicator take into account any additional costs associated with the geographical location. For instance, expenditure on travel from a person\u2019s place of residence to their workplace is not taken into account, although it is possible that the long commuting distance is the only reason that their housing costs remain below the 40% threshold.<br><br>By defining the threshold value as 40% of disposable household income, the indicator provides no information about average housing costs in absolute terms. If clusters emerge close to the threshold, even small alterations in the ratio of income to housing costs can cause major changes in the indicator. The indicator rose from 14.5% in 2010&nbsp;to a relatively constant 16% from 2011&nbsp;to 2016. In 2017, it went back down to the starting rate of 14.5%, before reducing further in 2018, to 14.2%, and yet further in 2019, when it reached 13.9%. The value is therefore lower than the level it started at in 2010. If the average trend recorded over the last five years continued, the goal set for 2030&nbsp;would be achieved.<br><br>With regard to the actual housing situation and disposable income, the indicator provides only a limited amount of meaningful information. After all, the calculation method means that households with high incomes and high expenditure on housing also appear to be overburdened. Meanwhile, the data show that it is people at risk of poverty&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;that is, those with less than 60% of the median equivalised income for the population&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;who are particularly affected by excessive housing costs. Some 42.2% of people at risk of poverty were overburdened by housing costs in 2010, rising to 54.4% by 2014. That figure then sank to 48.3% by 2019. In contrast, excessive housing costs affected a markedly smaller proportion of people considered not at risk of poverty. The 2019&nbsp;figure of 8.0% was lower than the 9.4% recorded in 2010&nbsp;and peak of 10.5% reached in 2011.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/destatis.png\" alt=\"Federal Statistical Office\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Statistical Office\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","source_url_1":"https://www.destatis.de/Europa/EN/Topic/Population-Labour-Social-Issues/Social-issues-living-conditions/_node.html;jsessionid=B340DD00C6EEDC7477B2AD2B54E4BC40.live731#587120","source_url_text_1":"Housing cost overburden","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/home\">Eurostat</a>","source_organisation_2_short":"<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/home\" target=\"_blank\">Eurostat</a>","source_organisation_logo_2":"<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/home\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/eurostat.png\" alt=\"Eurostat\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationEurostat\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","source_url_2":"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/ILC_LVHO07A/default/table?category=livcon.ilc.ilc_lv.ilc_lvho.ilc_lvho_hc","source_url_text_2":"Housing cost overburden rate - <abbr title=\"European Statistical Office\">Eurostat</abbr> table [ilc_lvho07a ]","weather_active_1":true,"weather_indicator_1":"11.3 Housing cost overload","weather_indicator_1_year_a":2019,"weather_indicator_1_year_b":2018,"weather_indicator_1_year_c":2017,"weather_indicator_1_year_d":2016,"weather_indicator_1_year_e":2015,"weather_indicator_1_target":"Reduce the proportion of people who are overburdened to 13% by 2030","weather_indicator_1_target_1":"Reduce the proportion of people who are overburdened to 13% by 2030","weather_indicator_1_target_1_category":"normal","weather_indicator_1_target_1_targetYear":2030,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_title":"If the trend from 2019 had continued, the target value would have been reached or missed by less than 5% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b_title":"If the trend from 2018 had continued, the target value would have been reached or missed by less than 5% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c_title":"If the trend from 2017 had continued, the target value would have been reached or missed by less than 5% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_d":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_d_title":"Although the indicator has in 2016 been moving in the desired direction toward the target, if the trend had to continued, the target would have been missed in the target year by more than 20% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_d_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_e":"Blitz","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_e_title":"In 2015 the distance to the target was constantly high or had increased.

A distinction is made between open space proper and open areas within settlement zones, such as cemeteries, gardens, parks and recreational amenities, which, although largely undeveloped, are generally considered part of settlement and transport area. As a result, if previously undeveloped parts of settlement land are built on, this is not reflected in the indicator for loss of open space area.<br><br>In the period under review, the national average for per capita loss of open space area went down. Whereas the four-year moving average for 2001-2004&nbsp;was still around 5&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Square meter\">m\u00b2</abbr> per capita, the current average for 2015-2018&nbsp;reveals a figure of just 3&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Square meter\">m\u00b2</abbr>.<br><br>Although subject to a similar trend, significant differences can be observed between rural and non-rural areas in terms of the degree of change. The loss of per capita open space area per inhabitant in rural areas contracted from 7.4&nbsp;to 4.5&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Square meter\">m\u00b2</abbr> per year In non-rural areas, it fell from 1.8&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Square meter\">m\u00b2</abbr> to 0.6&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Square meter\">m\u00b2</abbr>. In this context, it important to remember that non-rural districts and district-free cities have much less open space, such as forest or farmland, than rural areas do. Demographic trends also differ, and the indicator reflects those disparities, with rural areas mostly seeing their populations shrink during the period under review, while population numbers in non-rural areas rose slightly overall.<br><br>The data sources for the indicator are the population figures and the area survey by type of actual use compiled by the Federal Statistical Office. Since population data at regional level are used for the associated calculations, the 2011&nbsp;census caused a jump in the time series. Moreover, some areas of land have been reclassified in the official land register maintained by the L\u00e4nder in recent years, without any actual change to the landscape. To smooth out these effects and depict the long-term trend, a four-year moving average is shown, averaging out the figures for each year with those for the three preceding years. Additionally, the switch from the old to the new land-use classification system was completed in 2016, which affected the official land-use statistics such that the data for 2016&nbsp;are not directly comparable to those for previous years. This is why the development of the indicator for 2016&nbsp;is only shown as a broken outline in the graph.<br><br>The distinction between rural and non-rural is based on a classification used by the Th\u00fcnen Institute. The institute ascribes a degree of rurality to districts and district-free cities on the basis of geographical characteristics such as settlement density and share of farmland and woodland. The classification is thus applied to whole districts rather than to smaller entities like towns or villages.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/destatis.png\" alt=\"Federal Statistical Office\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Statistical Office\" style=\"height:60px;

This equates to a reduction of 6.9%.<br><br>However, the number of medium-sized and major cities grew from 1,010&nbsp;in 2012&nbsp;to 1,109&nbsp;in 2018. Much of this growth can be traced to the designation of additional urban centres as medium-sized cities in Bavaria.<br><br>It is beyond the purview of this report to assess whether that change of status reflects an actual improvement in the provision available in those cities. Nonetheless, the increase in medium-sized and major cities notably helped reduce the average travel time required to reach one.<br><br>If the average travel time for each reporting year is calculated on the basis of only those intermediate and major cities which existed in 2012, it is found to have decreased from 23.5&nbsp;minutes in 2012&nbsp;to 22.5&nbsp;minutes in 2018. This equates to a reduction in travel time of only 4.3% in relation to 2012.<br><br>The data for these calculations were taken from the timetables of Deutsche Bahn, various networks and numerous other transport providers. With the help of the timetable data, the travel times to the nearest intermediate or major city during peak morning traffic times were determined for some 258,000&nbsp;stops. This period is defined differently across the reporting years. Whereas connections with arrival times between 6&nbsp;<abbr title=\"before noon (ante meridiem)\">a.m.</abbr> and 9&nbsp;<abbr title=\"before noon (ante meridiem)\">a.m.</abbr> were taken into account in 2012, the figures for 2016&nbsp;and 2018&nbsp;refer to connections with arrival times between 8&nbsp;a.m and 12&nbsp;noon.<br><br>Not least because not all local transport schedules had been fully incorporated into the database used, the values for the different reporting years cannot be compared without caveats. Therefore, the frequency of transport services to the nearest intermediate or major city is ignored, as is travel time to and from the stopping point. Furthermore, this indicator is based on timetable data&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;which means that delays or even cancellations are not taken into account.<br><br>The classification of an urban centre as a medium-size or major city is determined according to the availability of goods, services and infrastructure that are not available in the surrounding regional towns. These include, among other things, specialist medical practices, hospitals, cultural facilities as well as secondary schools and institutions of higher education. In each intermediate or major city, especially in large cities, only one location in the city centre was designated as the destination. The destination stops were selected within a radius of one kilometre around that destination point, and the quickest connection from each departure stop to that point was sought. A population-weighted average value of the travel time for Germany was then determined with the help of small-scale population data from the Federal Statistical Office.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bbsr.bund.de/BBSR/EN/home/_node.html\">Federal Office for Building and Regional Planning</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.bbsr.bund.de/BBSR/EN/home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Office for Building and Regional Planning</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bbsr.bund.de/BBSR/EN/home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/bbsr.png\" alt=\"Federal Office for Building and Regional Planning\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Office for Building and Regional Planning\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","weather_active_1":true,"weather_indicator_1":"11.2.c Accessibility of medium-sized and large cities by public transport","weather_indicator_1_target":"Reduction of average travel time by public transport","weather_indicator_1_target_1":"Reduction of average travel time by public transport","weather_indicator_1_target_1_category":"normal","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a":null,"data_show_map":true,"copyright":"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2022","data_footnote":"Data is based on a special evaluation and is not publicly available.","graph_title":"Travel times by public transport to nearest medium-sized or major city","precision":[{"decimals":1.0}],"span_gaps":true,"show_line":true,"graph_type":"bar","data_start_values":[{"field":"Time series","value":"For the medium-sized and major cities of the year in question"}],"graph_stepsize":[{"step":5.0}],"national_geographical_coverage":"Germany","page_content":"\n\n<div>\n  <div class=\"my-header\">\n    <label class=\"default\">Average travel time by public transport: reduction\n    </label>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"my-header-note\">\n  <label class=\"default\"><b>(No evaluation possible)\n  </b></label>\n</div>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-30","national_data_updated_date":"2022-11-28","indicator_number":"11.2.c","target_number":"11.2","goal_number":"11","language":"en"},"7-1-ab":{"layout":"indicator","goal":"7","indicator":"7.1.ab","indicator_display":"7.1.a, b","indicator_sort_order":"7-1-ab","permalink":"/7-1-ab/","sdg_indicator":"7.3.1","reporting_status":"complete","published":true,"data_non_statistical":false,"national_indicator_available":"Final energy productivity and primary energy consumption","dns_indicator_definition":"The final energy productivity indicator shows the trend of value added for each unit of final energy used. \u201cFinal energy\u201d refers to the part of the energy that is available as thermal or electrical energy for the manufacture of goods or for use by households.<br>The primary energy consumption indicator shows how much energy has been consumed in a country, on the one hand for transformation by the energy industries and on the other hand in industry, households and transport.","dns_indicator_intention":"After the promotion of renewable energies, the reduction of energy consumption through increased energy efficiency is the second pillar of the energy transition.

The type of the goods imported is recorded in detail in addition to their country of origin, value and weight. The service sector is not included in the foreign-trade statistics.<br><br>The various countries\u2019 classification as <abbr title=\"Least developed countries\">LDCs</abbr> is taken from the list of <abbr title=\"Official development assistance\">ODA</abbr> recipients maintained by the <abbr title=\"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\">OECD</abbr>\u2019s Development Assistance Committee (<abbr title=\"Development Assistance Committee\">DAC</abbr>). The indicator uses the list of <abbr title=\"Least developed countries\">LDCs</abbr> valid according to the <abbr title=\"Development Assistance Committee\">DAC</abbr> for each particular reporting years. If the status of a country changes, this will have an impact on the indicator even if the value of imports from that country remains unchanged. However, changes in countries\u2019 status have scarcely affected the development of the indicator in the period shown.<br><br>The issue of reimports means that the possibility of duplicate entries in the numerator and denominator of the indicator cannot be ruled out. The fact that the imports from <abbr title=\"Least developed countries\">LDCs</abbr> are viewed in relation to all German imports must also be taken into account. The consequence is that the value of the indicator depends not only on the absolute quantity of imports from <abbr title=\"Least developed countries\">LDCs</abbr> but also on the value of all imports.<br><br>Alongside Germany\u2019s total imports from <abbr title=\"Least developed countries\">LDCs</abbr>, the indicator also shows what share is made up of processed products. The intention here is to address the question, at least to some extent, as to whether Germany mainly uses <abbr title=\"Least developed countries\">LDCs</abbr> as sources of basic materials for industrially produced goods or whether the <abbr title=\"Least developed countries\">LDCs</abbr> themselves have a stake in the manufacturing process and the associated value creation. These include all goods not classified as raw materials in the classification according to product groups of the food and industrial economy (<abbr title=\"Food and industrial economy\">EGW</abbr>). The term thus does not encompass products extracted from nature and not or hardly processed, such as petroleum, ores, timber in the rough or vegetable textile fibres. Conversely, cereals, vegetables, live animals, meat and milk are classified as processed products.<br><br>Imports from <abbr title=\"Least developed countries\">LDCs</abbr> accounted for 0.94% of all imports to Germany in 2019&nbsp;and were valued at <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 10.4&nbsp;billion. This equates to an increase of 116% compared with 2002, when that share was just 0.44%. However, the positive trend only goes back to 2008. The share of imports of processed products from <abbr title=\"Least developed countries\">LDCs</abbr> rose even more sharply between 2002&nbsp;and 2019&nbsp;(+151%). It reached 0.89% of total imports to Germany in 2019&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;compared to 0.36% in 2002&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;which equates to a value of around <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 9.9&nbsp;billion. That share has stagnated in the last three reporting years. Nonetheless, if the increase over the last five years continues, is it to be expected that the benchmark will be reached.<br><br>Closer analysis of the various countries of origin reveals that almost three quarters of Germany\u2019s imports from <abbr title=\"Least developed countries\">LDCs</abbr> in 2019&nbsp;came from Bangladesh (57%) or Cambodia (16%). If one looks not only at the <abbr title=\"Least developed countries\">LDCs</abbr> but at all developing and emerging countries, their share of total imports to Germany in 2019&nbsp;was 21.8%, and processed products from those countries accounted for 20.11% (up from 13.67% and 12.17% respectively in 2002). Imports from <abbr title=\"Least developed countries\">LDCs</abbr>, both in terms of all goods and in terms of processed goods, thus account for a rather small share of imports from developing and emerging countries. As is shown above, however, their share of Germany\u2019s total imports has increased more dramatically over time. Not only among developing and emerging countries but also more generally, China plays the most major role.

The figures are collated on behalf of the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure and published on the Government\u2019s Broadband Atlas.<br><br>As of the middle of 2020, fully fibre-optic internet connections (<abbr title=\"Fully fibre-optic networks\">FTTB/H</abbr>) capable of more than 1,000&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Megabit per second\">Mbps</abbr> were available in 13.8% of households in Germany. Between 2015&nbsp;and 2020, the availability of 1,000&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Megabit per second\">Mbps</abbr> FTTB/H broadband rose by 7.1&nbsp;percentage points. In other words, it more than doubled, increasing by +105.9%. From the end of 2018&nbsp;to the middle of 2020, the proportion of households with equally rapid connections using <abbr title=\"Cable television\">CATV</abbr> grew from 23.7&nbsp;to 50.2%. This is also more than double, equating to a +111.8% increase. Altogether, 55.9% of households had gigabit-capable connections available as of mid-2020.<br><br>Within the country, availability can be seen to vary depending on the region. For all technologies, the provision of gigabit broadband is concentrated particularly in urban areas, where some 74.6% of households had gigabit-speed internet access as of 2020. That figure is markedly lower for areas of a rural character, at 16.7% in 2020. To consider the distribution of the different technologies, 70.7% of urban and 7.8% of rural households had gigabit connections via <abbr title=\"Cable television\">CATV</abbr> in mid-2020, while gigabit-capable fibre broadband was available to 17.6% of households in urban areas and 8.9% of those in rural areas. Rural locations are thus predominantly supplied with gigabit speeds via fibre-optic networks, while urban areas rely more on <abbr title=\"Cable television\">CATV</abbr>.<br><br>Differences in availability between urban and more rural areas are also discernible among the L\u00e4nder. Of all the L\u00e4nder that are not city states, Schleswig-Holstein has the highest level of gigabit-speed provision using any technology in 2020, at 74.0% of all households, followed by North Rhine-Westphalia on 62.0%. At the other end of the scale, 12% of households in Saxony-Anhalt can say the same, with Brandenburg the next-lowest at 22.1%. In contrast, provision of gigabit-speed broadband is markedly higher than 90% in the three city states, Berlin, Bremen and Hamburg.<br><br>Various sources are used to calculate these data. Alongside the digital landscape model produced by the Federal Agency for Cartography and Geodesy and OpenStreetMap, more than 500&nbsp;telecommunications companies in Germany are surveyed about their current provision. To preserve the companies\u2019 business and trade secrets, the resultant data are aggregated into a grid of 250-metre by 250-metre cells and grouped according to seven classes of broadband.

The consequences of this are algae growth, oxygen depletion and even fish mortality or the growth of toxic blue-green algae. For this reason, adherence at all monitoring sites to the benchmark values indicated in the Ordinance on the Protection of Surface Waters (Oberfl\u00e4chengew\u00e4sserverordnung) for the relevant water types was defined as a goal for 2030.","data_state":"The data published in the indicator report 2022 is as of Oct 31 2022.

The data used for the indicator are taken from the surveillance network, which comprises some 250&nbsp;monitoring sites. In most cases, the monitoring sites were established in the main flows of the large rivers and at the mouths of important tributaries. The data are compiled by the Federal Environment Agency on the basis of information from the German Working Group on Water Issues of the L\u00e4nder and the Federal Government (<abbr title=\"German Working Group on Water Issues of the L\u00e4nder and the Federal Government\">LAWA</abbr>).<br><br>Each of the figures used to calculate the indicator value shows whether the annual average reading from a particular monitoring site adhered to or fell below the benchmark value but not the extent to which the threshold was exceeded. The information from the individual monitoring sites is presented in aggregated form. Accordingly, the value of the indicator depends on the number of monitoring sites and how representative their distribution is. Lakes and other bodies of water are not covered by the indicator.<br><br>Since the different bodies of water react with differing levels of sensitivity to nutrients such as phosphorous, the precise benchmark values vary. The vast majority of flowing waters use the benchmark value of 0.1&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\">mg/l</abbr> of phosphorous. In organic substrate-dominated rivers, the benchmark value is 0.15&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\">mg/l</abbr>, for marshland streams 0.3&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\">mg/l</abbr> and for transitional waters influenced by tidal movement 0.045&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\">mg/l</abbr>.<br><br>The indicators of phosphorous and nitrate levels (6.1.a and 6.1.b) cover two key aspects of water quality. However, there are other, additional components such as the existence of natural habitats around water bodies and the exposure to pollutants (such as pesticides, metals, medicines), all of which are also relevant to water quality. Phosphorous generally enters a body of water through the input of phosphates.<br><br>In 2018, the annual average of values measured was below the benchmark value at 44% of the monitoring points at rivers. 50% of the monitoring points showed average concentrations of up to twice the benchmark value, while 4% of the monitoring points were in the range of up to four times the benchmark value (not shown in the chart). The remaining 2% showed even higher concentrations.<br><br>When viewed over time, the proportion of monitoring points not exceeding the benchmark value has continuously increased and has doubled since 1990. However, the percentage rate of monitoring points with concentrations of up to twice the benchmark value tripled during the same period. Conversely, the share of monitoring points with even higher values has fallen significantly since the early 1990s. The level of pollution has been reduced significantly thanks in particular to the introduction of phosphate-free detergents and the specification of threshold values for the discharge of treated waste water.<br><br>Considering the average trend of the last five years, the indicator has developed slightly positively. The goal of not exceeding the specified threshold value at all monitoring points was still clearly missed.<br><br>","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en\">German Environment Agency on the basis of data from the German Working Group on Water Issues of the L\u00e4nder and the Federal Government (LAWA)</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en\" target=\"_blank\">German Environment Agency on the basis of data from the German Working Group on Water Issues of the L\u00e4nder and the Federal Government (LAWA)</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/uba.png\" alt=\"German Environment Agency on the basis of data from the German Working Group on Water Issues of the L\u00e4nder and the Federal Government (LAWA)\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationGerman Environment Agency on the basis of data from the German Working Group on Water Issues of the L\u00e4nder and the Federal Government (LAWA)\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","source_url_1":"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en/data/environmental-indicators/indicator-river-eutrophication-phosphorus","source_url_text_1":"Sampling sites which exceeded the requirement for good status for total phosphorus in rivers","weather_active_1":true,"weather_indicator_1":"6.1.a Phosphorous in flowing waters","weather_indicator_1_year_a":2020,"weather_indicator_1_year_b":2019,"weather_indicator_1_year_c":2018,"weather_indicator_1_year_d":2017,"weather_indicator_1_year_e":2016,"weather_indicator_1_year_f":2015,"weather_indicator_1_year_g":2014,"weather_indicator_1_target":"Not exceeding benchmark values for specific types of water bodies at all monitoring points by 2030","weather_indicator_1_target_1":"Not exceeding benchmark values for specific types of water bodies at all monitoring points by 2030","weather_indicator_1_target_1_category":"normal","weather_indicator_1_target_1_targetYear":2030,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_title":"Although the indicator has in 2020 been moving in the desired direction toward the target, if the trend had to continued, the target would have been missed in the target year by more than 20% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b_title":"Although the indicator has in 2019 been moving in the desired direction toward the target, if the trend had to continued, the target would have been missed in the target year by more than 20% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c_title":"Although the indicator has in 2018 been moving in the desired direction toward the target, if the trend had to continued, the target would have been missed in the target year by more than 20% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_d":"Blitz","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_d_title":"In 2017 the distance to the target was constantly high or had increased.

In the graph, the development of the indicator itself and of both the numerator and the denominator are traced separately.","dns_indicator_intention":"The extraction of raw materials always entails some impairment of the natural environment. Owing to the growing demand for raw materials, raw material deposits in all parts of the world are increasingly being extracted in areas that are particularly sensitive to human intervention. For this reason, back in 2016, in the German Resource Efficiency Programme (ProgRess) II, the German Government set itself the goal of ensuring a continuing rise in raw material input productivity. In the years 2000&nbsp;to 2010, raw material input productivity was already increasing at an average rate of around 1.6% annually. The aim is to maintain this kind of positive trend up to 2030.","data_state":"The data published in the indicator report 2022 is as of Oct 31 2022.

The calculation of this variable, designated as imports in raw material equivalents, is based on a complex model that employs data from various official and unofficial sources.<br><br>By considering imports in terms of both monetary value and mass, the indicator takes into account the value added and the raw material input along the entire domestic and foreign production chain. In this way, it also takes full account of the degree of economic interdependence with other countries. The raw material input reflected in the indicator covers not only domestic final use but also export. Accordingly, it should not be confused with a resource footprint for Germany.<br><br>Besides non-renewable resources&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;mineral resources and fossil fuels&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;the indicator also covers plant products from agriculture and forestry. As a result, there are a very few instances of double counting. For example, both the mass of a harvested agricultural product and that of the mineral fertiliser used to produce it are recorded.<br><br>According to preliminary data, the value of the indicator increased by 35% from 2000&nbsp;to 2016. This increase results in particular from the growth of the numerator, that is to say the value of final use (domestic consumption and domestic investment plus exports), which rose by 39% during the reference period. Domestic extraction of raw materials fell to a moderate extent between 2000&nbsp;and 2016; at the same time, however, the mass of imports in raw material equivalents increased, resulting in a slight increase of approximately 3% in the indicator denominator.<br><br>The export&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;or re-export&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;of domestically extracted and imported raw materials also increased. Consequently, the denominator of this indicator does not point to increased global raw material extraction for consumption and investment in Germany but reflects a generally closer interdependence between the German economy and the rest of the world.<br><br>Because of the exceptional economic situation during the European financial and economic crisis, the year 2009&nbsp;should be regarded as an outlier. In 2010&nbsp;and 2011, investments and exports, as well as the associated input of raw materials, rose sharply again. This marked a resumption of the trend that had been seen in the period up to 2008. From 2013&nbsp;to 2014, the value of the indicator rose by 4%, from 2014&nbsp;to 2015&nbsp;it rose by 7%, and from 2015&nbsp;to 2016&nbsp;it rose by 1%; the upward trend of the preceding years was thus maintained.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/destatis.png\" alt=\"Federal Statistical Office\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Statistical Office\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","source_url_1":"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Themes/Society-Environment/Environment/Environmental-Economic-Accounting/raw-material-flows-water/Tables/total-raw-material-productivity.html","source_url_text_1":"Raw material input productivity and ist components","weather_active_1":true,"weather_indicator_1":"8.1 Raw material input productivity","weather_indicator_1_year_a":2018,"weather_indicator_1_year_b":2017,"weather_indicator_1_year_c":2016,"weather_indicator_1_year_d":2015,"weather_indicator_1_year_e":2014,"weather_indicator_1_year_f":2013,"weather_indicator_1_year_g":2012,"weather_indicator_1_target":"Trend of the years 2000\u20132010&nbsp;to be maintained until 2030","weather_indicator_1_target_1":"Trend of the years 2000\u20132010&nbsp;to be maintained until 2030","weather_indicator_1_target_1_category":"normal","weather_indicator_1_target_1_targetYear":2030,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_title":"Although the indicator has in 2018 been moving in the desired direction toward the target, if the trend had to continued, the target would have been missed in the target year by more than 20% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b_title":"Although the indicator has in 2017 been moving in the desired direction toward the target, if the trend had to continued, the target would have been missed in the target year by more than 20% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c_title":"Although the indicator has in 2016 been moving in the desired direction toward the target, if the trend had to continued, the target would have been missed in the target year by more than 20% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_d":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_d_title":"Although the indicator has in 2015 been moving in the desired direction toward the target, if the trend had to continued, the target would have been missed in the target year by more than 20% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_d_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_e":"Blitz","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_e_title":"In 2014 the distance to the target was constantly high or had increased.

Between 2000&nbsp;and 2018, the amount of settlement and transport area in both rural and non-rural regions increased, though to differing extents&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;by 15% and 8% respectively. After rising slightly at the beginning of the century, the rural population then shrank by approximately 2.3% before increasing again by 1.8% between 2010&nbsp;and 2018. In contrast, the population in non-rural regions grew by 1.7% between 2000&nbsp;and 2010&nbsp;and again, by 5.4%, between 2011&nbsp;and 2018. The effects that the development of additional settlement and transport area had on the indicator were therefore amplified in rural regions by the declining population numbers there.<br><br>The data sources for this indicator are the population figures and the area survey by type of actual use compiled by the Federal Statistical Office. In the population numbers, the 2011&nbsp;census caused a jump in the time series. Some areas of land have moreover been reclassified in the official land register maintained by the L\u00e4nder in recent years, without any actual change in the way they are used. Additionally, the switch from the old to the new land-use classification system was completed in 2016, which affected the official land-use statistics such that the data for 2016&nbsp;are not directly comparable to those for previous years. So that comparisons can nevertheless be drawn, the relevant values were extrapolated on the basis of the 2011&nbsp;census and the 2016&nbsp;reform of the land-use survey.<br><br>The distinction between rural and non-rural is based on a classification used by the Th\u00fcnen Institute. The institute ascribes a degree of rurality to districts and district-free cities on the basis of geographical characteristics such as settlement density and share of farmland and woodland. The classification is thus applied to whole districts rather than to smaller entities like towns or villages.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/destatis.png\" alt=\"Federal Statistical Office\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Statistical Office\" style=\"height:60px;

Besides renewables, these sources also include imported electricity and fossil fuels such as coal and lignite, oil and gas.<br><br>The indicator is calculated by <abbr title=\"Working Group on Renewable Energy Statistics\">AGEE-Stat</abbr>, the Working Group on Renewable Energy Statistics. In contrast to the reporting under the Renewable Energy Directive of the European Union (Directive 2009/28/EC), uses an average value for hydro and wind power over several years to smoothen the effects of varying supply, this indicator takes account of the volumes of electricity actually generated from wind and hydro power (German Government Energy Concept).<br><br>With regard to the method used to calculate the indicator, it should be noted that imports and exports of electricity are not included in full in the consumption of energy from renewable sources, whereas they are factored into gross final energy consumption. Accordingly, the indicator may overstate or understate the ratio of energy from renewable sources to gross final energy consumption, depending on the balance of trade. If there were an export surplus for electricity&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;as has been the case since 2001&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;the actual percentage of renewables in the energy mix would be lower than the level represented by the indicator.<br><br>Between 2005&nbsp;and 2019, the share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption rose from 7.1% to 17.7%.

In 2019, the share accounted for 42.0% of gross electricity generation, 15.0% of final energy consumption for heating and cooling and 5.6% in the transport sector. Among renewable energies, biomass, with a share of 58.8% and wind power, which accounts for 24.1%, play the greatest part in primary energy consumption.<br><br>The indicator has dependencies with

It is calculated by dividing the body weight in kilograms by the square of an individual\u2019s height in metres (<abbr title=\"Kilogram per square meter\">kg/m\u00b2</abbr>). This calculation does not take account of age- and gender-specific differences or of an individual\u2019s body mass composition. Since the ratio of height to weight constantly changes in children and adolescents, there is no single threshold value for all age groups for the classification of excess weight and obesity. Excess weight and obesity among children and adolescents are defined by using an individual\u2019s age and gender to compare his or her <abbr title=\"Body Mass Index\">BMI</abbr> with those of a predefined reference population. The percentile reference values proposed by Katrin Kromeyer-Hauschild are used as a comparison, as recommended by the Childhood Obesity Federation (<abbr title=\"Childhood Obesity Federation\">AGA</abbr>). In this method, children and adolescents are said to be overweight if their <abbr title=\"Body Mass Index\">BMI</abbr> is above the 90th age and gender-specific percentile of the reference population (> <abbr title=\"90th percentile\">P90</abbr>), that is to say if they fall within the range of those 10% of the reference group with the highest <abbr title=\"Body Mass Index\">BMIs</abbr>. A <abbr title=\"Body Mass Index\">BMI</abbr> above the 97th percentile of the reference population (<abbr title=\"that is to say (id est)\">i.e.</abbr> as high as the 3% of children and adolescents with the highest <abbr title=\"Body Mass Index\">BMIs</abbr>) is classified as obesity (> <abbr title=\"97th percentile\">P97</abbr>). For example, girls and boys aged three with a <abbr title=\"Body Mass Index\">BMI</abbr> of 18.8&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Kilogram per square meter\">kg/m\u00b2</abbr> are considered to be obese. These reference values are based on details of body size and weight that were recorded between 1985&nbsp;and 1998&nbsp;in various regions of Germany, using different methods.<br><br>The data for the indicator was collected by the Robert Koch Institute. The German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (<abbr title=\"Study on the health of children and adolescents in Germany\">KiGGS</abbr>) for the period 2003&nbsp;to 2006&nbsp;delivered the first nationwide representative findings. Comparable measurement data are available for the period from 2014&nbsp;to 2017&nbsp;from the second follow-up of the <abbr title=\"Study on the health of children and adolescents in Germany\">KiGGS</abbr> study (<abbr title=\"Study on the health of children and adolescents in Germany\">KiGGS</abbr> Wave 2). To allow proper data comparison, the findings were standardised on the basis of extrapolated population data for 31&nbsp;December 2015.<br><br>For the 2014-2017&nbsp;period, 3.9% of the 3&nbsp;to 10-year-olds and 8.0% of the 11&nbsp;to 17-year-olds were classed as obese. While there were no differences between the sexes in the 3-10&nbsp;age group, the rates for the 11&nbsp;to 17-year-olds were 7.2% for girls and 8.7% for boys. In the period from 2003&nbsp;to 2006, the proportion of 3&nbsp;to 10-year-olds with obesity was about 5.2%; among the 11&nbsp;to 17-year-olds, it was about 8.3%. In that period too, girls and boys in the 3-10&nbsp;age group were equally affected. The figure for the 11-17&nbsp;age group broke down into 8.2% of the girls and 8.4% of the boys. The obesity rate has therefore fallen more sharply among 3&nbsp;to 10-year-olds than in the 11-17&nbsp;age group. While it fell by 1.0&nbsp;percentage points among girls aged 11&nbsp;to 17, it showed a slight increase of 0.3&nbsp;of a percentage point among boys in that age group.<br><br>The percentage of overweight 11-17-year-olds (> <abbr title=\"90th percentile\">P90</abbr>) had not changed substantially since the 2003-2006&nbsp;period, showing a decline of 0.6&nbsp;of a percentage point to 12.3% in the 3-10&nbsp;age group and an increase of 0.6&nbsp;of a percentage point to 18.7% among 11&nbsp;to 17-year-olds.<br><br>Key factors in becoming overweight are nutrition and exercise habits, which vary considerably when the findings are examined in the light of socio-economic status (<abbr title=\"Socioeconomic status\">SES</abbr>). The findings of <abbr title=\"Study on the health of children and adolescents in Germany\">KiGGS</abbr> Wave 2&nbsp;confirm that 3&nbsp;to 17-year-olds with a low socio-economic status more often have an unhealthy diet and more rarely take part in sport than their contemporaries with a higher socio-economic status. The risk of excess weight and obesity among 3&nbsp;to 17-year-olds with a low socio-economic status are about three to four times greater than in the high status group; each group comprises about 20% of the sample population.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.rki.de/EN/Home/homepage_node.html\">Robert Koch Institute</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.rki.de/EN/Home/homepage_node.html\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Koch Institute</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.rki.de/EN/Home/homepage_node.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/rki.png\" alt=\"Robert Koch Institute\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationRobert Koch Institute\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","weather_active_1":true,"weather_indicator_1":"3.1.e Obesity rate among children and adolescents","weather_indicator_1_target":"Increase to be permanently halted","weather_indicator_1_target_1":"Increase to be permanently halted","weather_indicator_1_target_1_category":"normal","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a":null,"data_show_map":false,"copyright":"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2022","data_footnotes":"Data is based on a special evaluation.<br>\u2022 Age-standardized data (population status: December 31, 2015).","graph_title":"Overweight and obese 3 to 10-year-olds and 11 to 17-year-olds","precision":[{"decimals":1.0}],"span_gaps":true,"show_line":true,"graph_type":"bar","data_start_values":[{"field":"Time series","value":"Obesity rate among children and adolescents"},{"field":"Age group","value":"3 to under 11 years"},{"field":"Age group","value":"11 to under 18 years"}],"graph_stepsize":[{"step":2.0}],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"Time series","national_geographical_coverage":"Germany","page_content":"\n\n<div>\n  <div class=\"my-header\">\n    <label class=\"default\">Obesity: increase to be permanently halted\n    </label>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"my-header-note\">\n  <label class=\"default\"><b>(No evaluation possible)\n  </b></label>\n</div>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-30","national_data_updated_date":"2022-11-28","indicator_number":"3.1.e","target_number":"3.1","goal_number":"3","language":"en"},"16-1":{"layout":"indicator","goal":"16","indicator":"16.1","indicator_display":"16.1","indicator_sort_order":"16-1","permalink":"/16-1/","reporting_status":"complete","published":true,"data_non_statistical":false,"national_indicator_available":"Criminal offences","dns_indicator_definition":"The indicator shows the number of criminal offences reported to the police per 100,000&nbsp;inhabitants.","dns_indicator_intention":"A safe environment in which people can live without fear of lawlessness and crime is an essential prerequisite for sustainable development.

To calculate the number of criminal offences per 100,000&nbsp;inhabitants, (extrapolated) population figures based on the 2011&nbsp;census are used for the entire time series. This methodology allows comparisons over time to be made from 1993&nbsp;onwards. It should be noted that this results in discrepancies in relation to the Police Crime Statistics data published prior to 2013.<br><br>Changes in the Police Crime Statistics do not always reflect actual changes, as the statistics cover only that proportion of criminal activity that officially comes to the attention of the police. Since there is no statistical data on offences which go unreported, such crimes cannot be reflected in the Police Crime Statistics. However, the proportion of reported versus unreported crime was investigated in 2012&nbsp;and 2017&nbsp;by means of the German Victim Survey. For the offences dealt with in the survey, no statistically significant change in reporting rates was found between 2012&nbsp;and 2017.<br><br>The number of offences was 6,548&nbsp;per 100,000&nbsp;inhabitants in 2019. If the trend seen in recent years continues, the target value of fewer than 6,500&nbsp;offences set for 2030&nbsp;will be achieved. The indicator fell by 21.6% between 1993&nbsp;and 2019. This trajectory, however, has not been continuous. For instance, it increased from 2000&nbsp;to 2004, before entering a slight decline which continued until 2010. The large number of people who entered Germany as refugees and asylum-seekers from 2015&nbsp;on is also reflected in the Police Crime Statistics, with violation of the legislation concerning foreigners (<abbr title=\"for example (exempli gratia)\">e.g.</abbr> illegal entry) soaring by 211.8% in 2016&nbsp;compared with 2014. Such offences had fallen drastically by 2019, though, when they made up only 3% of all criminal offences. Even when violations of the legislation concerning foreigners are accounted for, the total number of criminal offences registered by the police was lower in 2019&nbsp;than in previous years.<br><br>In 2019, the total number of criminal offences registered by the police was 5.4&nbsp;million. Of these, 1.6% involved domestic burglary, 15.3% involved fraud and 2.4% involved dangerous and serious bodily injury. Between 2014&nbsp;and 2019, the incidence of domestic burglary fell by 42.7% and fraud fell by 14%, while cases of dangerous and serious bodily injury rose by 5.8%. The success rate for solving cases was 57.5% of all offences registered by the police in 2019, roughly the same as in the previous year. There were significant differences, however, depending on the type of criminal offence. For domestic burglary, for example, the rate of cases solved was only 17.4%. By contrast, 66.6% of fraud offences and 82.9% of cases of serious and grievous bodily harm cases were cleared up. The comparatively low success rate for domestic burglary is related to a high rate of reporting combined with the comparatively infrequent existence of solid leads pointing to the perpetrators. This is in sharp contrast to cases of fraud and bodily injury. These crimes have high clear-up rates because, in most cases, the identity of the suspect becomes known to the police as the crime is reported.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bka.de/EN/Home/home_node.html\">Federal Criminal Police Office</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.bka.de/EN/Home/home_node.html\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Criminal Police Office</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bka.de/EN/Home/home_node.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/bka.png\" alt=\"Federal Criminal Police Office\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Criminal Police Office\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","source_url_1":"https://www.bka.de/EN/CurrentInformation/PoliceCrimeStatistics/policecrimestatistics_node.html","source_url_text_1":"Police Crime Statistics","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_2_short":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_logo_2":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/destatis.png\" alt=\"Federal Statistical Office\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Statistical Office\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","weather_active_1":true,"weather_indicator_1":"16.1 Criminal offences","weather_indicator_1_year_a":2021,"weather_indicator_1_year_b":2020,"weather_indicator_1_year_c":2019,"weather_indicator_1_year_d":2018,"weather_indicator_1_year_e":2017,"weather_indicator_1_year_f":2016,"weather_indicator_1_year_g":2015,"weather_indicator_1_target":"Reduce the number of criminal offences re-corded per 100,000&nbsp;inhabitants to less than 6,500&nbsp;by 2030","weather_indicator_1_target_1":"Reduce the number of criminal offences re-corded per 100,000&nbsp;inhabitants to less than <b>6,500&nbsp;</b>by <b>2030</b>","weather_indicator_1_target_1_category":"new","weather_indicator_1_target_1_targetYear":2030,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_validFrom":2021,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_title":"If the trend from 2021 had continued, the target value would have been reached or missed by less than 5% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b_title":"If the trend from 2020 had continued, the target value would have been reached or missed by less than 5% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c_title":"If the trend from 2019 had continued, the target value would have been reached or missed by less than 5% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_d":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_d_title":"If the trend from 2018 had continued, the target value would have been reached or missed by less than 5% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_d_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_e":"Sonne","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_e_title":"If the trend from 2017 had continued, the target value would have been reached or missed by less than 5% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_e_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_f":"Blitz","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_f_title":"In 2016 the distance to the target was constantly high or had increased.

Programmes are taken into account in the analyses if, by dint of their objectives, they fall directly under the heading of pandemic prevention and response or if they are primarily intended to enhance relevant capabilities in the field of health care. The programmes cover matters such as the pandemic prevention and response functions of the World Health Organization (<abbr title=\"World Health Organization\">WHO</abbr>), sanitation, One Health (a holistic approach that recognises the interconnection between human, animal and environmental health), vaccination infrastructure and research and development, both at home and abroad, in so far as the <abbr title=\"Research and development\">R&D</abbr> findings and innovations also benefit the countries of the Global South. Additionally, programmes launched in response to the <abbr title=\"Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2\">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;pandemic have also been taken into account. The latter include <abbr title=\"World Health Organization\">WHO</abbr> programmes and activities, humanitarian aid, vaccine development, crisis response and emergency assistance and loans to help health services in countries of the Global South to respond to the crisis. By definition, expenditure and pledges made in response to the <abbr title=\"Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2\">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;pandemic are excluded from the indicator and shown separately.<br><br>As regards the figures, it should be noted that it is not possible to draw hard and fast lines between the content of programmes, since the indicator field is closely interlinked with numerous other areas of the health system. The indicator therefore takes account of a range of programmes, such as Germany\u2019s contribution to the <abbr title=\"World Health Organization\">WHO</abbr> to support its emergency programme and to provide flexible initial funding for crisis response measures through the Contingency Fund for Emergencies, support for a vaccination programme for the reduction of child mortality in the East African Community, improvement of drinking water supply and sanitation in Burkina Faso and a biosecurity cooperation programme. Besides the thematic prioritisation, it should also be noted that some of the programmes are focused on general reinforcement of global coordination and organisational capacity and therefore do not exclusively benefit countries of the Global South.<br><br>Nor can a precise line be drawn between preventive and reactive measures. Developing preventive capacity may, for example, enhance responsiveness to a pandemic situation, while reactive measures may contribute to capacity-building in the long term. To avoid a statistical outlier resulting from the response to the <abbr title=\"Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2\">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;pandemic, these expenditure items and pledges are not part of the indicators but are shown separately in the chart.<br><br>The amounts of expenditure and pledges that are displayed, moreover, say nothing about the success of the programmes. The indicator represents Germany\u2019s monetary contribution to pandemic prevention and response. A more extensive assessment would be needed to gauge the impact of that contribution. In view of the foregoing provisos, therefore, the recorded figures are not by any means a full reflection of the German expenditure and pledges that directly or indirectly influence the pandemic prevention and response effort.<br><br>Between the years 2015&nbsp;and 2020, expenditure and pledges for pandemic prevention and response rose from <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 137.9&nbsp;million to <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 353.1&nbsp;million (provisional figure).

It simply uses the percentage ratio between the average gross hourly rates of pay. Factors such as qualification levels, hours worked and occupational experience profiles are not taken into account.<br><br>The data for the indicator are based on the four-yearly wage structure survey conducted by the statistical offices of the L\u00e4nder in the form of a representative sample survey with a disclosure obligation covering a maximum total of 60,000&nbsp;businesses. On the basis of these data, results are calculated, broken down by age group, education level, performance group, activity category, collective agreement coverage, company size class and economic sector, and the resulting adjusted gender pay gap (<abbr title=\"gender pay gap\">GPG</abbr>) is published. For the interim years, the rates of change from the quarterly wage survey are used to extrapolate the unadjusted <abbr title=\"gender pay gap\">GPG</abbr>. When the adjusted and the unadjusted <abbr title=\"gender pay gap\">GPG</abbr> are calculated, the <abbr title=\"European Union\">EU</abbr> categorisation is used, in which employees in agriculture, forestry and fishing and in public administration, defence and compulsory social security as well as employees of microenterprises are not taken into account.<br><br>According to provisional figures, the average unadjusted gender pay gap between women and men in 2019&nbsp;was 19%. This means that the average gross hourly pay earned by women was about a fifth lower than that earned by men. Over the longer term, a slow but steady narrowing of the unadjusted gender pay gap is evident in the whole of Germany. It stood at 22% in 2014, which is three percentage points higher than in 2019. If the trend recorded over the last five years continues, the target will not be achieved in 2020&nbsp;or in 2030.<br><br>At the same time, the picture for Germany is not a uniform one. There are considerable differences between L\u00e4nder: the highest unadjusted <abbr title=\"gender pay gap\">GPG</abbr> in 2019&nbsp;was 25% in Bremen, while in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and in Thuringia the gap was only 6%. Pay levels generally, however, were lower in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Thuringia than in Bremen.<br><br>Investigations into the causal factors behind the <abbr title=\"gender pay gap\">GPG</abbr> can be conducted every four years on the basis of the detailed results of the wage structure survey. The latest available findings date from 2018. The factors that determine pay differentials are subject to long-term evolution processes and are therefore fairly stable over the course of time. The findings show that structural causes account for 71% of the gender pay gap, in other words the differences are partly due to the fact that women often work in sectors and occupations where pay rates are low, and they more rarely attain managerial positions. They are also more likely than men to work part-time or to have mini-jobs. The remaining 29% of the pay differential corresponds to the adjusted <abbr title=\"gender pay gap\">GPG</abbr> of 6% in 2018. Compared with the unadjusted <abbr title=\"gender pay gap\">GPG</abbr>, the adjusted <abbr title=\"gender pay gap\">GPG</abbr> figure is considerably more uniform across the L\u00e4nder. In 2018, the adjusted gap ranged from 4% in Berlin to 7% in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Bavaria, Bremen, Hamburg and Saxony.<br><br>Comparative figures for the European Union are also available for 2018.

The source of the annually collected data is the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, which also reports in this context on climate finance from other federal ministries. In the case of bilateral climate finance, expenditure is calculated on the basis of funds allocated; in the case of multilateral climate finance and contributions to energy and climate funds, it is calculated on the basis of funds actually paid. The indicator also includes climate finance that is attributed to donors pro rata on the basis of their contributions to multilateral funds managed by development banks. As climate finance primarily benefits developing countries, it is considered to be part of official development expenditure (see indicator 17.1).<br><br>In 2019, Germany committed or provided <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 4.34&nbsp;billion in public funds for international climate finance for the reduction of greenhouse gases and adaptation to climate change. Compared with the previous year, when climate finance amounted to <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 3.37&nbsp;billion, this represents an increase of 29%. The target for 2020&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;to reach <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 4&nbsp;billion&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;was thus met a year early. In 2019, 44% of climate finance went to fund projects to reduce emissions, while 25% went towards adaptation to climate change. The remaining 31% was used to finance horizontal measures. As the horizontal measures serve both the reduction and adaptation efforts, the final split in 2019, as in previous years, shows more funds being used for emissions reduction (59%) than for adaptation (41%).<br><br>14% of climate finance, or <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 588&nbsp;million, was provided through multilateral channels in 2019. <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 248&nbsp;million of that can be attributed to Germany on the basis of the climate-related shares of Germany\u2019s contributions to multilateral development banks, the Global Environment Facility and the International Fund for Agricultural Development. Germany provides the remaining <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 340&nbsp;million through multilateral institutions and contributions to international climate funds.<br><br>In addition to official climate finance from public funds, Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (<abbr title=\"Reconstruction Loan Corporation (Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau)\">KfW</abbr>) and <abbr title=\"German Investment and Development Corporation (Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft)\">DEG</abbr> (Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft) also provide climate-related loans with funds from the market. These represent mobilised public climate finance and are not included in the indicator. In 2019, the resources mobilised in this way amounted to approximately <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 2.47&nbsp;billion, compared with <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 3.25&nbsp;billion the previous year.

The Alpine landscape is not currently taken into account, because of uncertainty of data.<br><br>The population size of each species is calculated annually from the results of bird-monitoring programmes by the Federation of German Avifaunists in cooperation with the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation and is expressed in relation to the target population size. The target value for each species is defined by a panel of experts. The historical values for 1970&nbsp;and 1975&nbsp;are reconstructed.<br><br>Each sub-indicator represents the arithmetic mean of the degrees of success achieved across the 10&nbsp;or 11&nbsp;selected avian species. The overall indicator is derived from a weighted summation of the sub-indicators. The weighting relates to the proportion of German territory which each main habitat or landscape type covers. On a provisional basis, the target values for the sub-indicators and the overall indicator have been applied unchanged to the 2030&nbsp;target year.<br><br>In 1990, the indicator for biodiversity and landscape quality was significantly lower than the reconstructed values for 1970&nbsp;and 1975. The indicator value stagnated over the last ten reporting years (2006-2016), reaching 70.5% of the target value in 2016&nbsp;compared with 70.2% in 2006. If this trend continues, the goal for 2030&nbsp;will not be achieved.<br><br>During the same period, however, the sub-indicators for the various types of habitat did not follow uniform trajectories. The farmland and coasts and seas sub-indicators fell during the last ten reporting years, to 60.5% and 58.0% of their target values in 2016&nbsp;respectively.

Gross fixed capital formation comprises resident producers\u2019 net acquisitions, <abbr title=\"that is to say (id est)\">i.e.</abbr> acquisitions less disposals, of fixed assets, excluding depreciation. Fixed assets are non-financial produced assets that are to be used repeatedly or continuously for more than a year in the production process. These include building structures, machinery and equipment (machines, vehicles and apparatus), military weapon systems and other systems (intellectual property such as investments in research and development, software, copyrights and mineral exploration as well as livestock and crops). They also include major improvements to existing stocks of fixed assets. Gross fixed capital formation is determined within the framework of the national accounts, which are compiled in accordance with harmonised European rules and are based on all available relevant data sources. As part of the major revision of 2019&nbsp;the national accounts calculations were thoroughly reviewed and revised, and the reference year was changed to 2015. As a result, nominal <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\">GDP</abbr> figures are slightly lower on average than they were before the major revision of 2019. The overall economic picture, however, has remained largely unchanged.<br><br>In 2019&nbsp;the ratio of gross fixed capital formation to <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\">GDP</abbr> was about 21.7%, which was 3.2&nbsp;percentage points below the initial value for 1991&nbsp;for the entire federal territory and 1.4&nbsp;percentage points lower than in the year 2000. In the short and medium term, the indicator has been moving in the right direction, with a slight increase recorded from 2015&nbsp;(20.0%) to 2019&nbsp;(21.7%). The price-adjusted ratio in 2019&nbsp;stood at about 21.2%. The average investment ratio in Germany over the years 2009&nbsp;to 2018, at 20.1%, was lower than the investment ratio for the entire <abbr title=\"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\">OECD</abbr> region (21.0&nbsp;%). The difference is smaller than in the period between 1999&nbsp;and 2008&nbsp;(-2.1&nbsp;percentage points).<br><br>The time series reveals an undulating trend in the investment ratio with a slump at the start of the millennium and, after a slight recovery, another slump in 2009&nbsp;following the financial and economic crisis of 2008/2009. By 2011&nbsp;investment activity had recovered, and gross fixed capital formation once again exceeded the level of the pre-crisis year. In the years from 2014&nbsp;to 2019, gross fixed capital formation soared by a total of 27.5%, reaching <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 774&nbsp;billion. Since the increase in nominal <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\">GDP</abbr> was somewhat lower, at 17.8%, the investment ratio increased slightly from 20.0% to 21.7&nbsp;%.<br><br>With regard to investments in building projects, housing construction has recorded strong nominal growth (+69.4%) since 2010, while the growth of investments in non-residential construction, including civil engineering, in the same period was less pronounced (+41.2%) and even dipped slightly in 2012&nbsp;and 2015. Investments in tangible fixed assets at current prices showed year-on-year increases of 4.9% in 2018&nbsp;and 1.9% in 2019. The highest growth rates for the period from 1991&nbsp;were recorded for investments in research and development as well as in software and databases.

The monitoring sites used for this purpose together form the so-called <abbr title=\"European Environment Agency\">EEA</abbr> monitoring network. The <abbr title=\"European Environment Agency\">EEA</abbr> monitoring network comprises a total of 1214&nbsp;monitoring sites and provides a representative picture of Germany. The data are compiled by the Federal Environment Agency from information provided by the German Working Group on Water Issues of the L\u00e4nder and the Federal Government (<abbr title=\"German Working Group on Water Issues of the L\u00e4nder and the Federal Government\">LAWA</abbr>).<br><br>Like the indicator of phosphorus content in flowing waters, the nitrate indicator does not reveal how far above or below the threshold the readings have been. The indicator merely records how many of all the monitoring sites complied with the prescribed threshold. The nitrate load may have fallen sharply at some monitoring sites. Nevertheless, if the concentration remains above the maximum of 50&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\">mg/l</abbr>, the reduction will not be reflected in the indicator.<br><br>The same applies to nitrate loads that have increased but are still below the threshold. The interpretation must also take into account that measures to reduce nitrate pollution may have a delayed effect, since the period of infiltration from the surface to the groundwater can take several years.<br><br>The naturally occurring level of nitrate lies between 0&nbsp;and 10&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\">mg/l</abbr>. Concentrations between 10&nbsp;and 25&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\">mg/l</abbr> indicate minor to medium loads. Concentrations between 25&nbsp;and 50&nbsp;milligrams per liter indicate severe groundwater contamination. Figures above the threshold of 50&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\">mg/l</abbr> which is set in the Ground Water Ordinance and which also underlies this indicator mean that the groundwater has a poor chemical status and cannot be used as drinking water without treatment.<br><br>In 2018&nbsp;the target of less than 50&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams\">mg</abbr> of nitrate per litre was met at 82.7&nbsp;of all monitoring sites. Since 2008, the percentage of monitoring sites at which this target is met has remained virtually unchanged. This means that the goal of recording concentrations below the threshold at all monitoring sites has not been achieved and that the indicator value is not recognisably moving in that direction. Conversely, in 2018&nbsp;the nitrate threshold of 50&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\">mg/l</abbr> was exceeded at 17.3% of the groundwater monitoring sites in the <abbr title=\"European Environment Agency\">EEA</abbr> monitoring network. Consequently, the groundwater at these locations cannot be used for drinking-water supplies without treatment. At 17.3% of the monitoring sites the nitrate value lay between 25&nbsp;and 50&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\">mg/l</abbr>, which still indicates an elevated degree of pollution. This percentage rate also remained virtually unchanged over the years.<br><br>The pollution of groundwater with nitrate is caused primarily by the leaching of nitrate from various nitrogen fertilisers. Besides farmyard manures such as liquid manure and slurry, these also include the mineral fertilisers that are used in intensive crop-farming. The last few years have also seen an increase in the use of digestate, which occurs as a by-product of biogas power plants, as an agricultural fertiliser. All of these things can contribute to higher nitrate values in groundwater if fertilisation is not matched to specific crop requirements. Accordingly, the development of indicator 2.1.a&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;Nitrogen surplus in agriculture&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;influences the nitrate load in groundwater.<br><br>In order to measure the actual influence of agricultural activity on the nitrate load of waters, there is a separate system of nitrate reporting to the <abbr title=\"European Union\">EU</abbr>. For this report, the monitoring sites for waters in predominantly agricultural catchment areas are selected from the <abbr title=\"European Environment Agency\">EEA</abbr> site network. The nitrate load in that specific part of the monitoring network is therefore above the average for indicator 6.1.b.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en\">German Environment Agency</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en\" target=\"_blank\">German Environment Agency</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/uba.png\" alt=\"German Environment Agency\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationGerman Environment Agency\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","source_url_1":"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en/data/environmental-indicators/indicator-nitrate-in-groundwater","source_url_text_1":"Nitrate in groundwater","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"<a href=\"https://www.lanuv.nrw.de/liki/index.php\">L\u00e4nderinitiative Kernindikatoren</a>","source_organisation_2_short":"<a href=\"https://www.lanuv.nrw.de/liki/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">L\u00e4nderinitiative Kernindikatoren</a>","source_organisation_logo_2":"<a href=\"https://www.lanuv.nrw.de/liki/index.php\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/liki.png\" alt=\"L\u00e4nderinitiative Kernindikatoren\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationL\u00e4nderinitiative Kernindikatoren\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","source_url_2":"https://www.liki.nrw.de/umwelt-und-gesundheit/c5-nitrat-im-grundwasser","source_url_text_2":"Nitrate in groundwater (only available in German)","weather_active_1":true,"weather_indicator_1":"6.1.b Nitrate in groundwater","weather_indicator_1_year_a":2020,"weather_indicator_1_year_b":2019,"weather_indicator_1_year_c":2018,"weather_indicator_1_year_d":2017,"weather_indicator_1_year_e":2016,"weather_indicator_1_year_f":2015,"weather_indicator_1_year_g":2014,"weather_indicator_1_target":"Compliance with the nitrate threshold value of 50&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\">mg/l</abbr> at all monitoring points by 2030","weather_indicator_1_target_1":"Compliance with the nitrate threshold value of 50&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\">mg/l</abbr> at all monitoring points by 2030","weather_indicator_1_target_1_category":"normal","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_title":"In 2020 the target value was not reached, but the average development pointed in the desired direction.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b_title":"In 2019 the target value was not reached, but the average development pointed in the desired direction.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c_title":"In 2018 the target value was not reached, but the average development pointed in the desired direction.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_d":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_d_title":"In 2017 the target value was not reached, but the average development pointed in the desired direction.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_d_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_e":"Blitz","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_e_title":"In 2016 the target value was missed and the indicator had not moved towards the target on average over the previous changes.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_e_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_f":"Blitz","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_f_title":"In 2015 the target value was missed and the indicator had not moved towards the target on average over the previous changes.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_f_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_g":"Blitz","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_g_title":"In 2014 the target value was missed and the indicator had not moved towards the target on average over the previous changes.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_g_valid":true,"graph_target_points":[{"type":"line","xMin":0,"xMax":13,"yMin":100,"yMax":100,"borderDash":[4,4],"borderColor":"#26bde2","preset":"target_points"},{"type":"label","xValue":6.0,"yValue":93.0,"backgroundColor":"transparent","content":["Annual target: 100"],"font":{"size":14},"borderColor":"transparent"}],"data_show_map":true,"copyright":"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2022","data_footnotes":"Basis <abbr title=\"European Environment Agency\">EEA</abbr> monitoring network: the threshold is an annual average of 50&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams\">mg</abbr> nitrate per litre of groundwater.<br>\u2022 Berlin, Bremen and Hamburg (city states): no data available.

This defined length of time may differ from the actual duration of care of which parents avail themselves. Contractually agreed childcare provision of seven hours and less, which can likewise make work and family life more compatible, and additional types of care such as day care at private homes are not included in the indicator. Information about childcare services for children aged six and older is also relevant to this topic. Such supplementary information is provided, for example, by data from the Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the L\u00e4nder in the Federal Republic of Germany (see the last section).<br><br>The information for these indicators is taken from the annual statistics of the Federal Statistical Office on children and employees in child daycare centres. In 2020, all-day care in child daycare centres had been arranged for 47.6% of children aged 3&nbsp;to 5&nbsp;(kindergarten age). This means that the proportion of 3&nbsp;to 5-year old children receiving all-day care increased by 25.6&nbsp;percentage points since 2006&nbsp;and had therefore more than doubled. The target of 60% which was set for 2020&nbsp;was not achieved. For children under three (nursery age), the proportion is about 17.1%. All-day care provision for children under three years of age, in other words, increased by 11.2&nbsp;percentage points from 2006&nbsp;to 2020&nbsp;and hence almost trebled.<br><br>The absolute number of children below the age of six receiving all-day care in child daycare centres came to about 1.53&nbsp;million in 2020. Another 67,385&nbsp;children below six years of age were receiving publicly subsidised childminder care; like those five-year-old children who are already at school, they are not covered by the indicator. In addition, in 2020&nbsp;some 1.3&nbsp;million children were receiving part-time care of seven hours or less.<br><br>More than a quarter of the children aged below six receiving care in daycare centres or publicly subsidised childminder care in 2019&nbsp;had a migration background, meaning that they had at least one parent of foreign origin. The care rate for these children was 50%, while the rate for children with no migration background was around 70%.<br><br>The percentages of children enrolled in daycare centres differs sharply between the old L\u00e4nder and the new L\u00e4nder. The highest full-time care rates for 0&nbsp;to 2-year-olds are recorded in the new L\u00e4nder and in Berlin. The figures range from 50.3% in Thuringia to 9.9% in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. For 3&nbsp;to 5-year-olds, the highest percentage of all-day care&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;92.2%&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;is also found in Thuringia, while Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg has the lowest ratio of 25.2% (both 2020).<br><br>In terms of childcare facilities for schoolchildren, after-school care centres and all-day schools also play an important role. In 2020, a total of 20,200&nbsp;children between 5&nbsp;and 13&nbsp;years of age were cared for on an all-day basis in after-school care centres, while about 492,600&nbsp;children received part-time care in those centres; classroom time is not counted as care time. In 2018/2019&nbsp;school year, of all pupils enrolled in schools providing a general education, 45.0% were in school all day. This figure, however, encompasses pupils at all stages of schooling, including pupils who are older than 13. In the same school year, 42.2% of the children in primary schools received all-day care. In comparison with 2006, the number of all-day pupils had risen sharply by 2018, from almost 1.5&nbsp;million to 3.3&nbsp;million in all schools providing a general education and from 400,000&nbsp;to around 1.2&nbsp;million in primary schools alone.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\">Federal Statistical

The introduction of parental allowance plus (ElterngeldPlus) and the partnership bonus (Partnerschaftsbonus) in particular are intended to keep driving social change in the stereotypical role models for mothers and fathers and ultimately to promote equality of opportunity in the labour market. For that reason, the German Government has set itself the target of increasing the proportion of fathers receiving parental allowance to 65% by 2030.","data_state":"The data published in the indicator report 2022 is as of Oct 31 2022.

To be eligible, claimants must have a permanent or common residence in Germany, live in the same household as their child, look after and bring up that child themselves and not engage in paid employment or, as the case may be, in full-time paid employment. Mothers and fathers are equally entitled.<br><br>Even if the child is not his or her natural child, the spouse or civil partner of the natural mother or father may receive parental allowance if both spouses or partners live in the same household. In more than 99% of cases, however, the beneficiaries are the biological parents, so that in the following simplified reference is made to mothers and fathers.<br><br>The figure for fathers receiving a share of parental allowance represents the percentage of children whose fathers received parental allowance as a percentage of all children born in a particular year for whom parental allowance was received. For the children born in 2008, fathers received parental allowance in 21.2% of cases, and this figure rose to 40.4% by 2017. The proportion of children whose mothers received parental allowance in the same period was far higher, amounting to about 98% in every year.<br><br>Although the percentage of fathers receiving parental allowance increased over time, the average period for which they received the allowance declined slightly from 3.7&nbsp;months for children born in 2008&nbsp;to 3.4&nbsp;months for children born in 2017.<br><br>These two effects also impacted on the development of the overall average period for which parental allowance was received by all fathers, <abbr title=\"that is to say (id est)\">i.e.</abbr> including those who did not receive any allowance. At the same time, the increase in the percentage of fathers receiving the allowance outweighed the decline in the period of receipt. The average period for which fathers in general obtained parental allowance increased from 0.8&nbsp;of a month for children born in 2008&nbsp;to 1.4&nbsp;months for those born in 2017. By comparison, the average period for which mothers in general received parental allowance rose from 11.5&nbsp;months for children born in 2008&nbsp;to 13.2&nbsp;months for those born in 2017.<br><br>The indicator is based on data from the parental allowance statistics, in which all payments of personal allowance are recorded on a quarterly basis. The figures relate in each case to the year of birth of the child for whom the allowance has been granted. The figure used to calculate the value of the indicator is the number of children for whom parental allowance was actually granted, not the total number of children born in Germany. This is intended to avoid the inclusion in the calculation of children for whom there is no entitlement to parental allowance, such as the children of foreign asylum-seekers.<br><br>It is not yet possible to differentiate precisely on the basis of the parental allowance statistics between types of partnership in which the eligible persons are living, <abbr title=\"that is to say (id est)\">i.e.</abbr> whether it is a same-sex partnership Therefore, for the purpose of calculating the indicator, it is assumed for simplification that exactly one father is entitled to benefits for each child.<br><br>For children born before 1&nbsp;July 2015, the maximum period for which parental allowance could be received was 14&nbsp;months. Parents whose children were born on or after 1&nbsp;July 2015&nbsp;are able to choose between basic parental allowance, parental allowance plus or a combination of both and can also obtain an additional partnership bonus in the form of four extra monthly payments of parental allowance plus. As a result, the period of receipt can be considerably extended.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/destatis.png\" alt=\"Federal Statistical Office\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Statistical Office\" style=\"height:60px;

Like nitrogen, phosphorus also leads to eutrophication. Phosphorus pollution in rivers is examined separately, in indicator 6.1.a.<br><br>The calculations for this indicator use monitoring data on nitrogen concentrations and on the discharge volumes of small and major rivers flowing into the North and Baltic Seas, which the Federal Environment Agency collates as reported by the L\u00e4nder and by river basin commissions. Data are also included for smaller rivers which do not flow directly into the North or Baltic Sea but are tributaries to larger rivers. In these cases, the data for each river are taken from its last monitoring site before the confluence. The Rhine is also included in the figures, even though its estuary is not in Germany. The data for the Rhine were recorded at the point where it leaves Germany (monitoring site at Bimmen, Kleve).<br><br>The nitrogen concentrations for each river are weighted for discharge volume, so that major rivers which discharge large qualities of water have a greater influence on the average that smaller ones. To prevent the graph being distorted by single extreme events like floods or droughts, which can result in anomalously very high or very low nitrogen inputs, the values are depicted as a five-year moving average.<br><br>The average nitrogen concentration for all North and Baltic Sea inflows, weighted for discharge volume, has followed a downward trend since the beginning of the time series, with the reduction in concentration more marked for the North Sea than the Baltic. The 2013-2017&nbsp;average for the North Sea inflows was a concentration of 3.0&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\">mg/l</abbr>.

Nevertheless, all three rivers showed a clear reduction in concentration across the five-year averages. That reduction was most marked in the Trave. In some of the smaller Baltic Sea inflows, concentrations of nitrogen are still several times higher than the management target, with values of up to 6.1&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Miligrams per litre\">mg/l</abbr>.<br><br>Among the North Sea inflows, only the Rhine met the management target in 2013-2017.

Gross electricity consumption is the sum of all generated and imported electricity minus the volume of exported electricity. It therefore comprises the electricity generated in Germany, the balance of exchanges across national borders, power stations\u2019 own electricity consumption and network losses. The following are considered to be renewable energies: wind power, hydro power, solar radiation energy, geothermal energy and biomass including biogas, biomethane, landfill gas and sludge gas as well as the biodegradable proportion of waste from households and industry.<br><br>Over the period from 2005&nbsp;to 2019, the share of renewable energies in electricity consumption increased from 10.3% to 42.0%. This means that the target set by the German Government in its energy policy blueprint of at least 35% by 2020&nbsp;was already achieved in 2017. This trend was accelerated by legal measures such as the Renewable Energy Sources Act (Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz). Among other things, the Act requires grid operators to give priority to energy from renewable sources for electricity feed-in. If the trend of past years continues, the target for 2030&nbsp;is also likely to be achieved.<br><br>As in the case of indicator 7.2.a, with regard to the calculation method it should be noted that external trade in electricity directly influences the denominator of the indicator but not the numerator. Regardless of whether electricity is produced from renewable sources, net exports reduce gross electricity consumption, while net imports increase gross electricity consumption. Since 2003, Germany has increasingly been a net exporter of electricity, which means that the indicator has been overstating the actual share of renewable energies in gross electricity consumption over the subsequent period.<br><br>Since 2005, the share of renewable energies in electricity generation has risen, particularly because of the increased use of wind power, photovoltaics and biomass. Between 2005&nbsp;and 2019, declining electricity generation from conventional energy sources was offset by an increase of almost 180&nbsp;terawatt-hours in the production of electricity from renewable sources. In particular, onshore and offshore electricity generation from wind power soared from 27.8&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Terawatt hour\">TWh</abbr> in 2005&nbsp;to 126&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Terawatt hour\">TWh</abbr> in 2019. Offshore wind farms contributed about 24.7&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Terawatt hour\">TWh</abbr> of the total in 2019. Electricity generation from photovoltaics rose between 2005&nbsp;and 2019&nbsp;from 1.3&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Terawatt hour\">TWh</abbr> to 46.4&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Terawatt hour\">TWh</abbr>. Electricity generation from biomass more than trebled in the same period to 50.2&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Terawatt hour\">TWh</abbr>.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a

The overall economic picture, however, has remained largely unchanged.<br><br>The debt-to-<abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\">GDP</abbr> ratio is influenced by the state of the public budgets and by economic development in general. The indicator measures a stock, namely the volume of debt, against a flow, namely the value of <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\">GDP</abbr>. With this formula, if the level of debt is constant, the faster <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\">GDP</abbr> grows the more sharply the ratio will fall. In the event of an economic upswing, then, the debt-to-<abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\">GDP</abbr> ratio will fall even if absolute total public debt does not. Conversely, the debt ratio may rise even though absolute debt decreases if <abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\">GDP</abbr> falls faster than the volume of debt.<br><br>The indicator, moreover, does not include implicit government debt, in other words future financial commitments for which funds are yet to be disbursed.<br><br>Between 2003&nbsp;and 2018, Germany\u2019s debt-to-<abbr title=\"Gross domestic product\">GDP</abbr> ratio was above the prescribed <abbr title=\"European Union\">EU</abbr>-wide reference level. Following budgetary consolidation measures, the ratio fell from 67.3% in 2005&nbsp;to 64.0% in 2007, but then it rose again to peak at 82.3% in 2010. This increase must be seen in the context of the financial and economic crisis. In that period, Germany\u2019s public debt rose by <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 511&nbsp;billion from <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 1,600&nbsp;billion to <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 2,111&nbsp;billion.<br><br>Over the last eight years the debt ratio steadily declined, reaching 59.6% in 2019, the first year since 2002&nbsp;in which it had fallen below the 60% reference value prescribed by the Maastricht Treaty. The German Bundesbank, however, expects that government debt will have increased sharply in 2020&nbsp;as a result of the <abbr title=\"Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2\">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;pandemic and that the debt ratio will again have risen considerably higher than the reference value. This development has not yet been factored into the current status calculation and so has had no bearing on the displayed weather symbol. A valid assessment will not be possible until the figures for 2020&nbsp;have been disseminated.<br><br>The Federal Government reduced its debt for the first time in 2015, lowering it by <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 24.3&nbsp;billion to <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 1,372&nbsp;billion. In 2019, the volume of federal debt stood at about <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 1,299&nbsp;billion. The debts of the L\u00e4nder fell from their high point in 2012&nbsp;by <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 75.1&nbsp;billion to <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 609&nbsp;billion in 2019. Local government debt had continued to fall since 2017, reaching <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 165&nbsp;billion in 2019. Between 2010&nbsp;and 2019&nbsp;the social insurance funds were able to reduce their debts by <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 651&nbsp;million to <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 695&nbsp;million. Of the total amount of government debt in 2019, about 62.6% was federal debt, while some 29.4% was owed by the L\u00e4nder and 8.0% by local government.<br><br>In the balance sheet, government debts are balanced against assets, both financial and non-financial. The largest items on the assets side are state-owned infrastructural properties, such as roads, schools and public buildings. According to the balance sheet drawn up by the Federal Statistical Office, these assets had a written-down value of <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 1,418&nbsp;billion in 2018. Financial assets were valued in 2018&nbsp;at <abbr title=\"Euro\">EUR</abbr> 1,291&nbsp;billion.

The measures taken into account include all short-, medium- and long-term formal and non-formal vocational training measures in developing and emerging countries. The measures are financed entirely by funds from the federal budget and from market funds provided through the Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (<abbr title=\"Reconstruction Loan Corporation (Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau)\">KfW</abbr>). The data were collected for the first time in 2015&nbsp;on behalf of the Ministry of Development by the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (<abbr title=\"German Agency for International Cooperation\">GIZ</abbr>) <abbr title=\"Company with limited liability\">GmbH</abbr> and Centrum f\u00fcr Evaluation <abbr title=\"Company with limited liability\">GmbH</abbr>, and are updated at three-annual intervals. This means that it is not yet possible to gauge the prospects of meeting the target on the basis of the methodology set out in the Indicator Report.<br><br>In 2018, some 863,000&nbsp;women and girls were reached by skills development measures.

A total of 31.6% of the women and girls were reached through institutional funding and 41.8% through measures in specific policy fields. Of all these women and girls, 93.0% were reached through financial cooperation.<br><br>Because women and girls in developing and emerging countries are reached by German development cooperation by three different levels, the data were searched for each of those levels. (1) In the case of individualised measures, the number of women and girls who received vocational training and continuing education or participated in individualised extension measures can be recorded directly. When it comes to (2) the funding of institutions and (3) the allocation of funds to specific policy fields, the number of beneficiaries reached in the supported training and further education facilities has to be estimated. In this case, the total number of female trainees and students in each of the funded education and training establishments as well as all women and girls receiving education or training in the relevant policy field are assumed to be beneficiaries of German development cooperation. As a result, there can be overestimates and duplication, especially in the figures for policy fields. Furthermore, in the case of follow-on projects or when two or more projects are implemented simultaneously in the same region, the possibility of double counting some of the beneficiary women and girls cannot be ruled out.<br><br>The value of the indicator depends heavily on the funding level, as funding through institutions or policy fields generally reaches more women and girls than individual measures. The indicator does not provide any information on the success, scope and quality of the qualification measures, which can vary considerably.

The latter has been calculating the indicator values for each reporting year since 2012.<br><br>The indicator is made up of the market share of products which either bear the highest category of <abbr title=\"European Union\">EU</abbr> energy label within their class or are certified by the <abbr title=\"European Union\">EU</abbr> Ecolabel, the Euro-leaf organic logo or the German Blue Angel. The <abbr title=\"European Union\">EU</abbr> energy label primarily addresses energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, while the other three ecolabels also take into account other threats to the environment such as pesticide use and harmful wastewater. The indicator is intended to show whether environmentally friendly product variants are replacing conventional ones in the market. Only a selection of product groups are examined, in part because limited data are available on turnover for products bearing sustainability labels. This also makes it possible to avoid certain products being counted more than once.<br><br>The indicator encompasses consumption in the fields of home life, mobility and nutrition. Household appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines, televisions and vacuum cleaners are assessed, as are light bulbs, foodstuffs, sanitary paper, detergents and cars. Since the markets for the individual product groups are of different sizes, the market shares are weighted according to the total turnover of the market in question. This is intended to prevent the indicator being distorted by products which have high shares of small niche markets. Furthermore, this means expenditure on environmentally friendly products can be considered in relation to the total expenditure of private households.<br><br>It is not possible to weight the market shares according to the market relevance of the respective product groups because the environmental labels address different categories (energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, material demand) that cannot be balanced against one another. This also makes it impossible to set out the environmental footprint, or comprehensive evaluation taking in several environmental categories, of each product group. Moreover, the indicator only covers goods newly brought into circulation in relation to the market as a whole. It thereby gives no indication as to whether the enhanced efficiency of an appliance results in a change in consumer behaviour and perhaps to an increase in consumption&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;the rebound effect. It also describes the market share on the basis of turnover. Given the price differences between products with and without the relevant ecolabels, this means no conclusions can be drawn about their numbers.
