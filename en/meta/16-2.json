Considered projects significantly differ with respect to volume and content. Projects with run-times longer than one year were counted more than once. Notably, the number of projects carried out says nothing about their scale or their level of success. Consequently, a directionally safe interpretation regarding scope and success of the measures is challenging. <br><br>According to the current evaluation, the number of projects undertaken each year increased from 8&nbsp;in 2006&nbsp;to 38&nbsp;in 2021. Thus the goal of Germany being involved in a minimum of 15&nbsp;projects would have been achieved in 2012&nbsp;for the first time. Except for 2013, the level would have been reached or even exceeded in subsequent years, too. According to the Federal Foreign Office, the regional focus of German efforts was on North, East and West Africa, the western Balkans and Ukraine. Other projects supported were in Latin America and the Caribbean.<br><br>The German Federal Government\u2019s Annual Disarmament Report contains a list of projects with the objective of <abbr title=\"Small arms and light weapons\" tabindex=\"0\">SALW</abbr> control, alongside their sources of funding. Their number differs from those reported for this indicator up to and including 2018. One reason for this may be the particular focus of individual projects, which affects whether they are taken into account.<br><br>In accordance with the guidelines on statistical reporting issued by its Development Assistance Committee, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (<abbr title=\"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\" tabindex=\"0\">OECD</abbr>) also publishes detailed figures on projects for reintegration and <abbr title=\"Small arms and light weapons\" tabindex=\"0\">SALW</abbr> control (<abbr title=\"Creditor Reporting System\" tabindex=\"0\">CRS</abbr> Purpose Code 15240). If the indicator were based on the number of projects counted in the above-mentioned <abbr title=\"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\" tabindex=\"0\">OECD</abbr> category, the target of at least 15&nbsp;projects would have been reached in 2006&nbsp;and every year since 2016. In 2020, the <abbr title=\"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\" tabindex=\"0\">OECD</abbr> counted 25&nbsp;projects. Among these, 19&nbsp;were funded by the Federal Foreign Office and, accordingly, 6&nbsp;projects were funded by the Federal Ministry of Finance. However, those projects also included measures for reintegrating former combatants from armed groups into society. Without such reintegration projects, the number of project exclusively or chiefly intended to combat <abbr title=\"Small arms and light weapons\" tabindex=\"0\">SALW</abbr> would be lower.","embedded_feature_html":"<p>Additional data series for the indicator can be found <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/AddInfos/en/16_2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" >here</a>.</p><br><small>Note: You can display the PDF document directly in your browser or download the PDF document and open it with a PDF reader of your choice.
