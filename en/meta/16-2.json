Inadequate security measures regarding small arms and ammunition can lead to conflict escalation and the illegal proliferation of weapons. Within the framework of its security policy responsibilities, the German Armed Forces (Bundeswehr) participate by deploying experts who train personnel in various regions around the world to strengthen small arms control and ammunition security.<br><br>The indicator shows the number of individuals who have been trained by the Bundeswehr in the fields of small arms control and ammunition security since 2024. The data are based on a special evaluation by the Bundeswehr\u2019s Verification Centre. The training covers topics such as storage security, weapon identification, ammunition transport, and documentation. A distinction is made between training in small arms control (identification, documentation, registration) and training in storage and ammunition security (Physical Security and Stockpile Management, PSSM). The latter focuses on the safe storage and transport of ammunition and explosives, as well as safety precautions for ammunition depots, including their distance from civilian settlements. The various training courses last from a few days to several weeks.<br><br>Approximately 5&nbsp;to 10&nbsp;training events are conducted annually, with around 15&nbsp;to 60&nbsp;participants trained per event. Regional priorities are set annually in coordination with the Federal Foreign Office. Currently, the focus is on Southeast Europe, including Ukraine; West Africa, particularly the ECOWAS region (Economic Community of West African States); and Central Asia. In 2024, 182&nbsp;specialists were trained, including 33&nbsp;women and 149&nbsp;men. The politically defined target is to train at least 1,000&nbsp;people in this field between early 2024&nbsp;and the end of 2030. The necessary annual training volume was achieved during the first reporting year in 2024.<br><br>All trained individuals are treated equally in the indicator, regardless of the duration and intensity of their training, which limits the indicator\u2019s explanatory power to some extent. Furthermore, no qualitative conclusions can be drawn from the indicator regarding the type of training or the subsequent practical application of the skills imparted. A revision in the form of retrospective or ongoing monitoring of the content taught&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;if carried out at all&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;is not part of the indicator. It is also not possible to determine to what extent or in what manner the trained personnel later contribute to preventing the illegal proliferation of weapons.</p>","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bmvg.de/de\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the Federal Ministry of Defence', 'En')\">Federal Ministry of Defence</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.bmvg.de/de\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the Federal Ministry of Defence', 'En')\">Federal Ministry of Defence</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.bmvg.de/de\" target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"return confirm_alert('the Federal Ministry of Defence', 'En')\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/bmvg.png\" alt=\"Federal Ministry of Defence\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Ministry of Defence\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border:transparent\"/></a>","source_url_1":"https://www.bmvg.de/de/themen/friedenssicherung/ruestungskontrolle/kontrolle-der-kleinwaffen-und-des-waffenhandels","source_url_text_1":"Control of small arms and the arms trade","source_url_alert_1":"the Federal Ministry of Defence","weather_active_1":true,"weather_indicator_1":"16.2 Personnel trained by the Bundeswehr to strengthen small arms control and ammunition safety","weather_indicator_1_year_a":2024,"weather_indicator_1_target":"Training of at least 1,000 people by Bundeswehr experts from 2024 to 2030","weather_indicator_1_target_1":"Training of at least 1,000 people by Bundeswehr experts from 2024 to 2030","weather_indicator_1_target_1_category":"normal","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a":"Keine","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_title":"No assessment possible.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_valid":true,"graph_target_points":[{"type":"label","xValue":3.0,"yValue":850.0,"backgroundColor":"rgba(203, 200, 200, 0.7)","borderRadius":5,"content":["Target:","1,000"],"font":{"size":14},"borderColor":"transparent"}],"data_show_map":false,"copyright":"&copy; Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), 2025","data_footnote":"The data is based on a special evaluation and is not publicly accessible.","graph_title":"Personnel trained by the Bundeswehr between 2024 and 2030 to strengthen small arms control and ammunition safety","graph_annotations":[{"value":1000,"label":{"content":"Target","position":"left","backgroundColor":"transparent","color":"transparent"},"preset":"target_line","borderColor":"transparent"}],"span_gaps":true,"show_line":true,"graph_type":"bar","data_start_values":[{"field":"Time series","value":"Personnel trained by the Bundeswehr to strengthen small arms control and ammunition security"},{"field":"Display","value":"Trained personnel"},{"field":"Display","value":"Trained personnel still required to achieve the target"}],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"Display","rating":"","target_description":"<u>Target formulation:</u><br>The number of people trained by experts from the German Armed Forces (Bundeswehr) should be increased to a total of 1,000 persons between 2024 and 2030.<br><br><u>Assessment:</u><br>An assessment of indicator 16.2 is not possible.
