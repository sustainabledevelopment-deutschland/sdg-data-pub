The aim is to achieve a high level of economic output while using as little energy as possible. Energy saving protects the climate and the environment and helps to improve the security of supply and industrial competitiveness.<br>According to the German Government\u2019s energy blueprint, final energy productivity is to be increased by 2.1% annually from 2008&nbsp;to 2050. At the same time, primary energy consumption is to be reduced by 20% from its 2008&nbsp;level by 2020, 30% by 2030&nbsp;and 50% by 2050.","data_state":"The data published in the indicator report 2022 is as of Oct 31 2022. The data shown on this platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/facts_publications/\">indicator report 2022</a>.","indicator_name":"Final energy productivity and primary energy consumption","section":"Resource conservation","postulate":"Using resources economically and efficiently","target_id":"7.1.1","previous":"6-2-ab","next":"7-2-a","content_and_progress":"<b>Text from the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/facts_publications/\">Indicator Report 2021&nbsp;</a></b><br><br>Final energy consumption and primary energy consumption are directly related to one another. Final energy consumption is primary energy consumption less total losses from transformation, flaring and distribution and the statistical difference.<br><br>Primary energy consumption is the sum of domestically extracted primary energy sources, use of stocks and all imported energy sources minus storage, energy exports and marine bunkers. The main basis for the calculation of energy consumption comprises the data on energy balances from the Energy Balance Association (<abbr title=\"Energy Balance Association\">AGEB</abbr>), which are supplemented with data from other sources.<br><br>Final energy productivity means how much added value accrues from each unit of final energy used. It constitutes a measurement of energy efficiency in the production of goods and in household energy use. However, estimates of energy efficiency in the transformation process (plant efficiency) or in the transmission of energy (elimination of leakages, improved heat insulation, <abbr title=\"and so on (et cetera)\">etc.</abbr>) cannot be directly inferred from the indicator.<br><br>According to provisional findings, final energy productivity in the period from 2008&nbsp;to 2019&nbsp;increased by 15.4%, which equates to an average annual increase of about 1.4%. This means that the goal of an annual increase of 2.1% on average up to 2050&nbsp;is not yet being achieved. In 2019, energy productivity showed a slight year-on-year decline of 0.6&nbsp;percentage points.<br><br>Primary energy consumption registered a year-on-year decline in 2019. Provisional findings indicate that primary energy consumption fell by 11.1% in the period from 2008&nbsp;to 2019. Accordingly, if the trend of past years were to remain unchanged, the target value for 2020&nbsp;would not be achieved.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a
