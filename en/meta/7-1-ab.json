The concept of \u201cfinal energy\u201d refers to the part of the energy that is used energetically in terms of thermal or electric energy in the production sectors for the manufacturing of goods or by households.<br>The indicator \u201dPrimary energy consumption\u201d specifies how much energy was consumed by a country in the energy sectors for conversion purposes on the one hand, and by production activities, transport and households on the other.","dns_indicator_intention":"Along with the expansion of renewable energies, the reduction of energy consumption through increased energy efficiency represents the second supporting pillar of the energy transition. The goal is to achieve a high level of economic output while using as little energy as possible. Saving energy protects the climate and the environment, it helps to improve the security of supply and the industrial competitiveness.<br>According to the Federal Government\u2019s energy concept, final energy productivity is to be increased by 2.1&nbsp;% annually or 139&nbsp;% in total in the period 2008&nbsp;to 2050. At the same time, primary energy consumption is to be reduced by 20&nbsp;% by 2020, by 30&nbsp;% by 2030, and by 50&nbsp;% by 2050, compared with 2008.","data_state":"The data published in the indicator report 2022 is as of 31 October 2022. The data shown on this platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/publications_reports/\">indicator report 2022</a>.","indicator_name":"Final energy productivity and primary energy consumption","section":"Resource conservation","postulate":"Using resources economically and efficiently","target_id":"7.1.1","previous":"6-2-ab","next":"7-2-a","content_and_progress":"<b>Text from the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/publications_reports/\">Indicator Report 2022&nbsp;</a></b><br><br>Final energy consumption and primary energy consumption are directly related to one another. Final energy consumption is primary energy consumption less total losses from transformation, flaring and distribution and the statistical difference.<br><br>Primary energy consumption is the sum of domestically extracted primary energy sources, use of stocks and all imported energy sources minus storage, energy exports and marine bunkers. The main basis for the calculation of energy consumption comprises the data on energy balances from the Energy Balance Association (<abbr title=\"Energy Balance Association\" tabindex=\"0\">AGEB</abbr>), which are supplemented with data from other sources.<br><br>Final energy productivity means how much added value accrues from each unit of final energy used. It constitutes a measurement of energy efficiency in the production of goods and in household energy use. However, estimates of energy efficiency in the transformation process (plant efficiency) or in the transmission of energy (elimination of leakages, improved heat insulation, <abbr title=\"and so on (et cetera)\" tabindex=\"0\">etc.</abbr>) cannot be directly inferred from the indicator.<br><br>According to preliminary results, final energy productivity in the period 2008&nbsp;to 2021&nbsp;increased by 19.5&nbsp;%, equating to an average annual increase of 1.4&nbsp;%. This means that the goal of an annual increase of 2.1&nbsp;% on average up to 2050&nbsp;has not yet been achieved. In the year-on-year comparison, energy productivity for 2021&nbsp;has even fallen by 0.6&nbsp;percentage points. If the development of the preceding five years continues, the final energy productivity will presumably increase by 73.2&nbsp;% until 2050. Thus, the target value would be missed by 65.8&nbsp;percentage points. An average annual increase of final energy production by 2.4&nbsp;% is required in order to meet the target set for 2050.<br><br>Primary energy consumption decreased to 82.7&nbsp;% in 2020&nbsp;and missed the reduction target of 20&nbsp;% by 2020. According to preliminary results, the primary energy consumption increased in 2021&nbsp;by 3.6&nbsp;% percentage points in comparison to 2020. The total reduction of primary energy consumption fell by 13.7&nbsp;% in the period from 2008&nbsp;to 2021. If development remains the same as in the previous years, the target value of 30&nbsp;% by 2030&nbsp;will not be achieved.","embedded_feature_html":"<p>Additional data series for the indicator can be found <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/AddInfos/en/7_1_ab.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" >here</a>.</p><br><small>Note: You can display the PDF document directly in your browser or download the PDF document and open it with a PDF reader of your choice.
