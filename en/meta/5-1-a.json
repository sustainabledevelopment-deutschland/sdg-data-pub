A narrowing of pay disparities is an indicator of progress on the road to equality. The German Government has therefore been pursuing the target of reducing the pay gap to 10% by 2020&nbsp;and maintaining it until 2030.","data_state":"The data published in the indicator report 2022 is as of Oct 31 2022. The data shown on this platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/facts_publications/\">indicator report 2022</a>.","indicator_name":"Gender pay gap","section":"Equality","postulate":"Promoting equality and a partnership-based division of responsibilities","target_id":"5.1.1","previous":"4-2-ab","next":"5-1-bc","content_and_progress":"<b>Text from the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/facts_publications/\">Indicator Report 2021&nbsp;</a></b><br><br>The indicator presented here shows the unadjusted gender pay gap. It simply uses the percentage ratio between the average gross hourly rates of pay. Factors such as qualification levels, hours worked and occupational experience profiles are not taken into account.<br><br>The data for the indicator are based on the four-yearly wage structure survey conducted by the statistical offices of the L\u00e4nder in the form of a representative sample survey with a disclosure obligation covering a maximum total of 60,000&nbsp;businesses. On the basis of these data, results are calculated, broken down by age group, education level, performance group, activity category, collective agreement coverage, company size class and economic sector, and the resulting adjusted gender pay gap (<abbr title=\"gender pay gap\">GPG</abbr>) is published. For the interim years, the rates of change from the quarterly wage survey are used to extrapolate the unadjusted <abbr title=\"gender pay gap\">GPG</abbr>. When the adjusted and the unadjusted <abbr title=\"gender pay gap\">GPG</abbr> are calculated, the <abbr title=\"European Union\">EU</abbr> categorisation is used, in which employees in agriculture, forestry and fishing and in public administration, defence and compulsory social security as well as employees of microenterprises are not taken into account.<br><br>According to provisional figures, the average unadjusted gender pay gap between women and men in 2019&nbsp;was 19%. This means that the average gross hourly pay earned by women was about a fifth lower than that earned by men. Over the longer term, a slow but steady narrowing of the unadjusted gender pay gap is evident in the whole of Germany. It stood at 22% in 2014, which is three percentage points higher than in 2019. If the trend recorded over the last five years continues, the target will not be achieved in 2020&nbsp;or in 2030.<br><br>At the same time, the picture for Germany is not a uniform one. There are considerable differences between L\u00e4nder: the highest unadjusted <abbr title=\"gender pay gap\">GPG</abbr> in 2019&nbsp;was 25% in Bremen, while in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and in Thuringia the gap was only 6%. Pay levels generally, however, were lower in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Thuringia than in Bremen.<br><br>Investigations into the causal factors behind the <abbr title=\"gender pay gap\">GPG</abbr> can be conducted every four years on the basis of the detailed results of the wage structure survey. The latest available findings date from 2018. The factors that determine pay differentials are subject to long-term evolution processes and are therefore fairly stable over the course of time. The findings show that structural causes account for 71% of the gender pay gap, in other words the differences are partly due to the fact that women often work in sectors and occupations where pay rates are low, and they more rarely attain managerial positions. They are also more likely than men to work part-time or to have mini-jobs. The remaining 29% of the pay differential corresponds to the adjusted <abbr title=\"gender pay gap\">GPG</abbr> of 6% in 2018. Compared with the unadjusted <abbr title=\"gender pay gap\">GPG</abbr>, the adjusted <abbr title=\"gender pay gap\">GPG</abbr> figure is considerably more uniform across the L\u00e4nder. In 2018, the adjusted gap ranged from 4% in Berlin to 7% in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Bavaria, Bremen, Hamburg and Saxony.<br><br>Comparative figures for the European Union are also available for 2018. At 20%, the unadjusted gender pay gap in Germany for 2018&nbsp;lay considerably above the provisional European Union average of 15%. Of the 28&nbsp;<abbr title=\"European Union\">EU</abbr> states in 2018, only Estonia, with 22% had a higher gender pay gap. The countries with the lowest gender differentials in gross hourly pay were Luxembourg, with 1%, and Romania, with 2%.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"www.dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/destatis.png\" alt=\"Federal Statistical Office\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Statistical Office\" style=\"height:60px; width:148px; border: transparent\"/></a>","source_url_1":"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Themes/Labour/Earnings/Earnings-Earnings-Differences/Tables/ugpg-01-by-territory-gpg.html","source_url_text_1":"Unadjusted gender pay gap","source_url_1b":"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Themes/Labour/Earnings/Earnings-Earnings-Differences/Tables/ugpg-02-by-laender-at2014.html","source_url_text_1b":"Unadjusted Gender Pay Gap by L\u00e4nder","weather_active_1":true,"weather_indicator_1":"5.1.a Gender pay gap","weather_indicator_1_year_a":2021,"weather_indicator_1_year_b":2020,"weather_indicator_1_year_c":2019,"weather_indicator_1_year_d":2018,"weather_indicator_1_year_e":2017,"weather_indicator_1_year_f":2016,"weather_indicator_1_year_g":2015,"weather_indicator_1_target":"Reduce the gap to 10% by 2020, maintained until 2030&nbsp;subsequently","weather_indicator_1_target_1":"Reduce the gap to 10% by 2020","weather_indicator_1_target_1_category":"normal","weather_indicator_1_target_1_targetYear":2020,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a":null,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_title":"No evaluation possible.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_a_valid":false,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b_title":"Although the indicator has in 2020 been moving in the desired direction toward the target, if the trend had to continued, the target would have been missed in the target year by more than 20% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_b_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c_title":"Although the indicator has in 2019 been moving in the desired direction toward the target, if the trend had to continued, the target would have been missed in the target year by more than 20% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_c_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_d":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_d_title":"Although the indicator has in 2018 been moving in the desired direction toward the target, if the trend had to continued, the target would have been missed in the target year by more than 20% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_d_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_e":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_e_title":"Although the indicator has in 2017 been moving in the desired direction toward the target, if the trend had to continued, the target would have been missed in the target year by more than 20% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_e_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_f":"Wolke","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_f_title":"Although the indicator has in 2016 been moving in the desired direction toward the target, if the trend had to continued, the target would have been missed in the target year by more than 20% of the difference between the target value and the value at that time.","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_f_valid":true,"weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_g":"Blitz","weather_indicator_1_target_1_item_g_title":"In 2015 the distance to the target was constantly high or had increased.
