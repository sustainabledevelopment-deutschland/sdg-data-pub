A narrowing of pay disparities indicates progress on the road to equality. The Federal Government is therefore pursuing the goal of reducing the pay gap to 10&nbsp;% by 2020&nbsp;and to maintain the value until 2030.","data_state":"The data published in the indicator report 2022 is as of Oct 31 2022. The data shown on this platform is updated regularly, so that more current data may be available online than published in the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/publications_reports/\">indicator report 2022</a>.","indicator_name":"Gender pay gap","section":"Equality","postulate":"Promoting equality and a partnership-based division of responsibilities","target_id":"5.1.1","previous":"4-2-ab","next":"5-1-bc","content_and_progress":"<b>Text from the <a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/publications_reports/\">Indicator Report 2022&nbsp;</a></b><br><br>The indicator presented here shows the unadjusted gender pay gap (<abbr title=\"Gender pay gap\" tabindex=\"0\">GPG</abbr>). Therefore, it only expresses the relative average gross hourly earnings as a ratio without considering the underlying causes, such as qualification, occupation or a different employment history.<br><br>The data for the indicator is based on the four-yearly structure of earnings survey conducted by the statistical offices of the L\u00e4nder as a representative sample survey covering a maximum of 60,000&nbsp;businesses who are obliged to provide the requested information. Based on these data, results are provided by age, educational attainment, performance group, activity, collective agreement, company size class and economic sector, and the adjusted <abbr title=\"Gender pay gap\" tabindex=\"0\">GPG</abbr> is published. For the interim years, the unadjusted <abbr title=\"Gender pay gap\" tabindex=\"0\">GPG</abbr> is updated using the rates of change from the quarterly survey of earnings. In the following, the <abbr title=\"European Union\" tabindex=\"0\">EU</abbr> definition is used for the adjusted and unadjusted GPG; it excludes employees in \u201cagriculture, forestry and fishing\u201d, \u201cpublic administration and defence; compulsory social security\u201d and in micro-enterprises.<br><br>In 2020&nbsp;and 2021, the unadjusted <abbr title=\"Gender pay gap\" tabindex=\"0\">GPG</abbr> was 18&nbsp;% on average. The goal to reduce the unadjusted <abbr title=\"Gender pay gap\" tabindex=\"0\">GPG</abbr> to 10&nbsp;% by 2020&nbsp;was missed. Hence, if the trend recorded over the last five years continues, the goal set for 2030&nbsp;will not be achieved.<br><br>The unadjusted <abbr title=\"Gender pay gap\" tabindex=\"0\">GPG</abbr> is slowly but steadily declining for Germany long-term. The value in 2012&nbsp;was 23&nbsp;% and, thus, 5&nbsp;percentage points above the value in 2021. The unadjusted <abbr title=\"Gender pay gap\" tabindex=\"0\">GPG</abbr> varied markedly between the L\u00e4nder: in 2021, the <abbr title=\"Gender pay gap\" tabindex=\"0\">GPG</abbr> was highest in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Bremen with 22&nbsp;%, while being at 5&nbsp;% for Brandenburg, Mecklenburg Western Pomerania and Thuringia.<br><br>Investigations into the causal factors behind the <abbr title=\"Gender pay gap\" tabindex=\"0\">GPG</abbr> can be conducted every four years on the basis of the detailed results of the structure of earnings survey. The latest available findings date from 2018. The factors that determine pay differentials are subject to long-term evolution processes and are therefore fairly stable over the course of time. The findings show that structural causes account for 71&nbsp;% of the <abbr title=\"Gender pay gap\" tabindex=\"0\">GPG</abbr>, in other words the differences are partly due to the fact that women often work in sectors and occupations where pay rates are low, and they more rarely attain managerial positions. They are also more likely than men to work part-time or to have mini-jobs.<br><br>The remaining 29&nbsp;% of the pay differential corresponds to the adjusted <abbr title=\"Gender pay gap\" tabindex=\"0\">GPG</abbr> of 6&nbsp;% in 2018. Compared with the unadjusted <abbr title=\"Gender pay gap\" tabindex=\"0\">GPG</abbr>, the adjusted <abbr title=\"Gender pay gap\" tabindex=\"0\">GPG</abbr> figure is considerably more uniform across the L\u00e4nder. In 2018, the adjusted gap ranged from 4&nbsp;% in Berlin to 7&nbsp;% in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Bavaria, Bremen, Hamburg and Saxony.<br><br>Comparative data for the European Union with mostly provisional results is available until 2020. From 2010&nbsp;on, the unadjusted <abbr title=\"Gender pay gap\" tabindex=\"0\">GPG</abbr> in Germany lay considerably above the provisional European Union average. Of the 25&nbsp;<abbr title=\"European Union\" tabindex=\"0\">EU</abbr> states in 2020, only Latvia, with 22&nbsp;%, Estonia, with 21&nbsp;%, and Austria, with 19&nbsp;%, had a higher <abbr title=\"Gender pay gap\" tabindex=\"0\">GPG</abbr>. The countries with the lowest gender differentials in gross hourly pay were Luxembourg, with 1&nbsp;%, Romania, with 2&nbsp;%, and Slovenia, with 3&nbsp;%.","embedded_feature_html":"<p>Additional data series for the indicator can be found(<a href=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/public/AddInfos/en/5_1_a.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" >here</a>.</p><br><small>Note: You can display the PDF document directly in your browser or download the PDF document and open it with a PDF reader of your choice.
