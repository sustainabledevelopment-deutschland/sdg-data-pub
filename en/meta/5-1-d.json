Parents are entitled to parental allowance if they are resident or ordinarily resident in Germany, live in the same household as their child, are responsible for the child's care and upbringing and have no or only limited gainful employment. The regulations apply equally to mothers and fathers. The parents' spouses or partners are also eligible if they live in the same household. In over 99% of cases, the beneficiaries are biological or adoptive parents.<sup>1</sup> <br><br>The indicator is based on the quarterly parental allowance statistics, in which all approved parental allowance benefits are recorded. It shows the proportion of children born in a particular year whose fathers received parental allowance in relation to all children in that year for whom parental allowance was received. As only children who are entitled to parental allowance are taken into account, children of foreign asylum seekers who are not entitled to parental allowance, for example, are not taken into account and therefore have no influence on the indicator. The data is based on the completed parental allowance payments per birth cohort. Complete data is therefore generally only available around two years after the end of the respective birth year.<br><br>A differentiation by type of partnership (same-sex or opposite-sex) is not possible due to the current survey methodology. For the sake of simplicity, it is therefore assumed that each child is assigned exactly one father entitled to benefits. Until June 30, 2015, the maximum period of entitlement was limited to 14&nbsp;months. For children born from July 1, 2015, parents can choose between different benefit models or combine them: Basic Parental Allowance, Parental Allowance Plus and Partnership Bonus. Depending on the model chosen, the period of entitlement can vary significantly.<br><br>The indicator only shows the actual amount of parental allowance received. It does not include the duration of entitlement or the possible extent of part-time employment while receiving parental allowance. Since April 1, 2025, new income limits have applied to the receipt of parental allowance. This new regulation could influence the development of the indicator in future, as fewer couples are likely to be eligible.<br><br><b>Development</b><br><br>Between 2008&nbsp;and 2022, the proportion of fathers receiving parental allowance increased significantly. The proportion of children whose fathers received parental allowance increased from 21.2% in 2008&nbsp;to 46.3% in 2022. Maternal participation remained constant at a high level of around 98% over the same period. Despite this trend, the politically set target of increasing the proportion of children with fathers receiving parental allowance to at least 65% by 2030&nbsp;is unlikely to be achieved if the trend remains the same.<br><br>The increase in paternal participation was accompanied by a slight decrease in the average duration of receipt per father. While fathers received parental allowance for children born in 2008&nbsp;for an average of 3.7&nbsp;months, the figure for the 2022&nbsp;cohort was only 3.3&nbsp;months. However, as more fathers participated overall, the total number of parental allowance months claimed by fathers increased. In relation to all eligible fathers&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;that is, including those who did not apply &#8209; the average number of months claimed rose from 0.8&nbsp;(2008) to 1.5&nbsp;months (2022).<br><br>The average duration of entitlement for mothers (in relation to all eligible mothers) was significantly higher in comparison: it was 11.5&nbsp;months for the 2008&nbsp;cohort and rose to 13.8&nbsp;months for the 2022&nbsp;cohort.<br><br>A regional comparison for 2022&nbsp;shows clear differences in paternal participation: The highest proportions were recorded in Sachsen (55.4%) and Bayern (53.8%), while Bremen (35.0%) and Saarland (34.8%) had the lowest figures.<br><br><small><sup>1</sup> For ease of reading, the terms <i>mothers</i> and <i>fathers</i> are used in simplified form below.</small></p>","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_1_short":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Statistical Office</a>","source_organisation_logo_1":"<a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/OrgImgEn/destatis.png\" alt=\"Federal Statistical Office\" title=\" Click here to visit the homepage of the organizationFederal Statistical Office\" style=\"height:60px;
