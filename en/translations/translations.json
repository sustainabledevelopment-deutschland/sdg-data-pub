The measure of trends in ex situ conserved materials provides an overall assessment of the extent to which we are managing to maintain and/or increase the total genetic diversity available for future use and thus protected from any permanent loss of genetic diversity which may occur in the natural habitat, i.e. in situ, or on-farm.

Plant genetic resources  The plant component is calculated as the number of accessions of plant genetic resources secured in sample of seeds, planting materials or plants which is maintained in a genebank.
